Value Co-Creation: A Strategy for Enhancing Inclusiveness in Special Education,"This qualitative study examines the educational management practices of a municipality in Thailand by evaluating the current delivery of special educational services with underlying principles rooted in value co-creation (VCC)—a business concept often employed to enhance engagement and participation with the aim of creating mutual value. The study’s objective is to identify gaps in real-life practices. The research methodology encompasses in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, focus group discussions involving school board members and parents, and content analysis to extract core concepts for policy recommendations. The study’s findings reveal that the municipality is increasingly recognizing the potential of VCC in enhancing student outcomes, particularly for those with special educational needs. However, challenges stemming from schools’ financial constraints and the influx of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds impede the full realization of VCC principles. Consequently, it is crucial for the government to prioritize the alignment of VCC strategies with special education. This can be achieved by considering reengineering the education budget allocation and making investments, whether direct or indirect, to support the VCC process. These measures are essential to promote the evolution of VCC and sustain special educational service operations effectively.

University Teaching as a Site for Professional Learning of Teacher Educators: The Role of Collaborative Inquiry and Reflection within a Professional Learning Community,"While initial teacher education (ITE) has been acknowledged as an important process for improving the quality of education by preparing future teachers, less attention has been paid to the support of the continuous professional learning of teacher educators (TEs). This study reports on the supporting processes and tools for a collaborative inquiry-based systematic reflection of five TEs and the effects of their use in constructing professional knowledge about ITE. The reflective written reports and reflective discussions of the TEs are thematically analysed to show the focus of inquiry, the links among inquiry, reflection, and action, as well as the contributing role of collaboration within a professional learning community (PLC). The results show that the TE inquiry was a continuous process of exploring the beliefs, understandings, and participation of pre-service teachers (PSTs) during teaching; the impact of the teaching context on TE actions and decisions; and the ways in which their collaboration enhanced professional learning. The inquiry results informed the reflections and practice design of TEs. Guiding questions, sustained interactions among the PLC members, and support from a facilitator created opportunities for the collaborative construction of the professional learning of TEs. This article provides TEs or/and facilitators of PLCs in teacher education with a methodology for supporting professional knowledge through collaborative inquiry and reflection.

Empowering Vocational Students: A Research-Based Framework for Computational Thinking Integration,"Vocational Education and Training (VET) faces significant challenges in equipping individuals for modern workplaces, which increasingly require digital literacy and Computational Thinking (CT) skills. This paper addresses the imperative of integrating CT into VET programs and outlines key research questions. Our methodology primarily involves a systematic literature review, resulting in the identification of 29 relevant papers. Through qualitative content analysis, we develop a CT integration framework that connects CT practices and integration elements to the engineering design process, while highlighting the VET context. Arguably, the innovative aspect of this framework lies in its core dimensions of harnessing computational power for enhanced efficiency. Raising the question of whether computers can optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of specific tasks is paramount for addressing challenges in technology-rich environments. Therefore, this inquiry merits unwavering attention at every stage of the process. The proposed framework provides educators with a structured approach to identify integration opportunities and help prepare students for multifaceted vocational careers. Furthermore, other key findings underscore the inherently interdisciplinary nature of VET, the growing demand for STEM competencies, and the transformative potential of CT integration. Implications emphasize the need for further research, supportive policies, and practical CT integration. Despite limitations, this study strongly advocates for CT integration, empowering VET students for success in the contemporary workforce.

Do Good Intentions Lead to Expected Outcomes? Professional Learning Amongst Early Career Academics in a Problem-Based Program,"This paper presents findings from a study of pedagogical beliefs and practices amongst early career academics attending an extensive professional development program. The research questions of this study were as follows: how do early career academics define their pedagogical beliefs in relation to a pedagogical development program, and how do their beliefs manifest in their pedagogical practice? This study was based on a qualitative document analysis of 145 project reports written as the finalizing part of the early career academics’ participation in the program. Reports were collected with the consent of participants, coded, and analyzed to search for emerging pedagogical beliefs and subsequent practices. The findings indicate that while almost all participants express beliefs that are aligned with the core values of the university, their reported practices are quite diverse. Based on this, we propose a framework for understanding teaching development amongst early career academics centered on their individual development and their interaction with students. This framework provides a contribution to our understanding of the teaching trajectories of early career academics and the intricate interplay between pedagogical beliefs and pedagogical practice. This framework may be of use for educational developers when planning and conducting pedagogical development activities.

Independent Semantic and Syntactic Representations in L2 Mandarin Learners: Evidence from Structural Priming,"Structural representations in English have been shown to be quite abstract, with structural information being represented independently from semantic information. Mandarin has a relatively sparse marking of syntactic information, with no inflections for case, number, or tense. Given this syntactic sparsity, Huang et al. (2016) hypothesized that, distinct from English-language findings, Mandarin learners may have shared syntactic and semantic representations, such that semantic information can guide structure building. We examined this question in L2 Mandarin learners using a structural priming paradigm that required reading Mandarin primes. We found that L2 Mandarin learners exhibit within-language structural priming, and this effect is independent of semantic information. These findings have two implications: (1) this represents the first demonstration of within-language L2 Mandarin structural priming; (2) L2 learners can develop syntactic representations independent of semantic representations, even when the target L2 language lacks rich marking of syntactic information.

Teachers in the Loop: Integrating Computational Thinking and Mathematics to Build Early Place Value Understanding,"With increasing attention on the potential overlap between computational thinking (CT) and mathematical reasoning, STEM education researchers seek to understand how integrating CT and mathematics can deepen student learning across disciplines. Although there are various professional development programs that introduce teachers to CT concepts and strategies for curriculum integration, limited research exists on how teachers might apply this knowledge to create math + CT activities for use with their students. Additionally, the majority of research on CT integration through programming has focused on upper elementary grades, leaving the early grades (K-2) relatively unexplored. This qualitative exploratory study aims to examine how teachers in a graduate STEM education program collaborated with university STEM faculty to explore and critique a set of integrated math + CT block-based programming activities designed to build place value conceptual understanding. In-service elementary teachers enrolled in an online graduate CT course for educators (n = 13) explored these activities as learners and drew on their experiences as classroom teachers to offer feedback for program redesign. A sequence of deductive pattern coding and inductive holistic coding of course transcripts, collaborative problem-solving slides, and individual teacher reflections provided insights into how teachers were able to establish connections between their mathematical knowledge related to teaching place value and their emerging understanding of CT concepts, such as abstraction, algorithms, decomposition, and debugging. Implications for the design of professional development for elementary teachers on integrating CT and mathematics are offered.

Non-Digital Games That Promote Mathematical Learning in Primary Years Students: A Systematic Review,"Despite primary school teachers demonstrating strong preferences for using non-digital games over digital games to support mathematics instruction, much of the research review literature has focused on learning outcomes associated with digital mathematical games. To address this gap, the current systematic literature review focuses on non-digital, games-based, empirical studies in the primary mathematics classroom over the past two decades from 2003 to 2022. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) statement was employed as a guideline for the data-collection process. The review presents an analysis and synthesis of 34 manuscripts, representing 32 distinct studies. Over three-quarters of manuscripts employed quantitative methodologies and around half qualitative methodologies, whilst studies focused exclusively on student, as opposed to teacher, outcomes. Despite Australia and Indonesia being comparatively overrepresented, the studies in scope were notable for both their geographic diversity and the eclectic range of game types and structures incorporated; although they did tend to disproportionately focus on number and operations, as opposed to other mathematical content areas. Moreover, the impact of mathematical games was generally positive across the broad range of outcomes considered, suggesting that mathematical games are potentially effective for both developing mathematical proficiencies, as well as improving dispositions towards mathematics. Future research directions are discussed.

Technology-Mediated Hindustani Dhrupad Music Education: An Ethnographic Contribution to the 4E Cognition Perspective,"Embodiment lies at the core of music cognition, prompting recent pedagogical shifts towards a multi-sensory, whole-body approach. However, the education of oral music genres that rely exclusively on direct teacher–disciple transmission through live demonstration and imitation is now undergoing a transformation by rapidly adapting to technology-mediated platforms. This paper examines challenges in embodied facets of video-mediated synchronous distance Hindustani music pedagogy. For this, it takes an ethnomusicological stance and showcases a thematic analysis of interviews featuring Dhrupad music practitioners. The analysis is driven and organized by the 4E Cognition principles, which stress the intimate relationship between body, mind, and environment. Findings indicate that while this adaptation aims to make music content more widely accessible, it comes at the cost of reducing opportunities for multi-modal engagement and interaction among participants. Results reveal limitations in transmitting non-verbal, embodied, multi-sensory cues, along with visual and acoustic disruptions of a sense of shared spatial and physical context, that hinder effective interaction and a sense of immersion, elements that are deemed vital in music education. They prompt concerns about the suitability of conventional videoconferencing platforms and offer key insights for the development of alternative technologies that can better assist embodied demands of the pedagogical practices involved.

What If I Were the Exile? Linking Past and Present for Democratic History Teaching with Pre-Service Educators,"The academic literature has fostered a debate in recent decades regarding the concept of historical empathy and the typology of activities that can help to treat and develop it, although there is no consensus as to the real effectiveness of narrative activities of a descriptive type that involve the projection of the person into the past. The aim of this research was to check whether the implementation of a programme that uses historical contextualisation, contact with primary testimonies, the use of sources and historical empathy, linking the situation of the exiles of the Spanish Civil War with the current refugees, can contribute to the development of tolerant attitudes towards the figure of the displaced in pre-service teachers and the degree to which these attitudes are modified after the application of the programme. The research design is quantitative and corresponds to a quasi-experimental design with a control and experimental group. A questionnaire was used to measure the attitudes of 101 pre-service teachers at a Spanish university towards refugees. The questionnaire was completed at two different times, before and after a historical empathy exercise on the exiles of the Spanish Civil War. The results indicate that programmes using historical contextualisation, testimonies close to refugees and historical empathy relating the situation of refugees to that of the exiles of the Spanish Civil War can contribute to increasing and/or reinforcing positive attitudes towards refugees in pre-service teachers.

"Motivational Climate, Physical Self-Concept, and Social Relationships in Adolescents in Physical Education Classes: A Systematic Review","The aim of the present study was to provide a comprehensive summary of scientific evidence related with the influence on physical self-concept and prosocial behaviours in adolescents, taking into account the motivational climate generated in Physical Education classes by the teacher. Studies with similar samples have shown that special consideration must be given to the motivational climate of involvement with the task and the coach’s style in support of autonomy in a greater occurrence of prosocial behaviours in the sports context, which shows that the social context is the most important variable in the direction of moral behaviours. Following the application of a search protocol in the Web of Science (WoS) database, 131 articles were initially identified, with eight manuscripts finally being analysed according to previously established criteria for the various stages of the PRISMA checklist. Despite only a relatively small number of articles being available to have rigorously evaluated the topic of interest, analysed studies revealed a direct relationship between motivational climate and physical self-concept. In contrast, no relationship emerged with prosocial behaviour.

Bridging the Gap between Theoretical Learning and Practical Application: A Qualitative Study in the Italian Educational Context,"In the contemporary educational landscape, there is a growing recognition of the transformative impact of practical experiences within traditional learning frameworks. This shift reflects a pedagogical evolution that values contextualized learning and the acquisition of practical skills together with theoretical knowledge. In the Italian educational context, School–Work Alternation (SWA) represents a proactive response to the evolving needs of the workforce and the imperative for educational institutions to prepare students for professional life. This study’s objectives include a deep exploration of students’ SWA experience, evaluating its impact on employability perceptions and the sense of agency, examining the influence of Self-Orientation, and contributing insights to the discourse on integrating practical experiences in education. Employing a mixed methodology and a bottom-up approach, 63 high school students of different Italian regions participated in an online in-depth interview and an ad hoc questionnaire designed to measure the experience of SWA in relation to variables of interest, utility, advantage, perception of support, quality of received mentoring, engagement, and satisfaction. The quantitative results indicate that personal choice significantly influences the perceived usefulness of and satisfaction with SWA, with those students guided by curiosity exhibiting higher utility and satisfaction. Qualitative analysis underscores both positive and negative aspects, with respondents viewing SWA as a useful experience bridging work, corporate, and school realms provided that students are key players in the SWA experience’s choice and that the SWA’s partners are motivated to guide them in this practical training. Moreover, results highlight SWA’s relevance in guiding academic and career paths, emphasizing its potential to offer valuable support to students. This study contributes nuanced insights into integrating practical experiences in education, offering recommendations for educators and policymakers to better prepare students for the dynamic demands of the modern job market.

Democratisation and Educational Inclusion during Lockdown Times: Perceptions of Portuguese Teachers,"The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on school education, as confirmed by numerous studies produced at the international level. One of the most profound effects was the potential change to the political mandates of schools and resulting alterations in professional teaching practices, given the proliferation of remote (online and blended) teaching. This article aims to explore the extent to which the pandemic crisis has reconfigured schools’ educational priorities, with an emphasis on democratisation and inclusion at the expense of learning outcomes and meritocratic approaches. Based on an extensive study as part of a wider international project, the results of a questionnaire survey of Portuguese teachers (n = 3983) during the initial lockdown period in 2020 are analysed. The empirical evidence suggests that the pandemic resulted in a strengthening of the democratising pole, underpinned by the principles of equal opportunities, inclusion, and social justice, even though the practices and priorities of teachers as a whole are not homogeneous. This heterogeneity reflects pre-existing professional and school cultures, which vary depending on level of education, gender, school type, and career length, among other important factors.

From Research to Retweets—Exploring the Role of Educational Twitter (X) Communities in Promoting Science Communication and Evidence-Based Teaching,"Twitter has evolved from its initial purpose as a microblogging social network to a pivotal platform for science communication. Equally, it has gained significant popularity among teachers who utilize communities like the German #twitterlehrerzimmer (TWLZ; Twitter teachers’ lounge) as a digital professional learning network. (1) Background: To date, no studies examine how science communication is conducted on Twitter specifically tailored to teachers’ needs and whether this facilitates evidence-based teaching. (2) Methods: Answering the three research questions involved a comprehensive mixed methods approach comprising an online teacher survey, utility analysis using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) models, and machine learning-assisted tweet analyses. (3) Results: Teachers implement research findings from the TWLZ in their teaching about twice a month. They prefer interactive tweets with specific content-related, communicative, and interactive tweet features. Science communication in the TWLZ differs from everyday communication but notably emphasizes the relevance of transfer events for educational practice. (4) Conclusions: Findings highlight that dialogue is essential for successful science communication. Practical implications arise from new guidelines on how research findings should be communicated and encourage teachers to reflect on their Twitter usage and attitude toward evidence-based teaching. Recommendations for further research in this emerging field are also discussed.

Learning to Become a Physics Teacher: A Case Study of Experienced Teachers,"This paper focuses on Wegner’s concept of learning to examine how experienced physics teachers conceptualize and explain their professional identity. Participants were four female physics teachers with more than 15 years of teaching experience. These four teachers were selected as illustrative and contrastive cases for the purpose of the study. The data collection included semi-structured interviews and field notes from classroom observations in each participant’s classroom. Interview and classroom observation data were analyzed through the constant-comparative method. The results showed that these teachers had positive and negative experiences in different types of schools; and higher-achieving students motivated these teachers to solve different types of problems. Although teachers believed that science should be taught through experiments or inquiry-based instruction, they did not have any opportunity to teach in a laboratory. Their role was confined to teaching in a classroom to solve problems. They defined their concept of learning to become a physics teacher with metaphors that focused on the cognitive demands of teaching and the learning process. Further research on teacher education should support teacher development through addressing social and epistemic demands of teaching and learning.

Activity Proposals to Improve Children’s Climate Literacy and Environmental Literacy,"With the climate crisis, schools have a fundamental role to enrich children’s climate literacy, which should begin in their early years and continue for life. Developing activities in the classroom can be an excellent way of bringing this about. This work is part of a larger research project, during which a previous study was carried out with 245 children aged 9 to 13, in which we identified some limitations in their knowledge about climate change. Based on these results, we decided to present some proposals for activities that could help improve these children’s climate literacy. The study we conducted was of an exploratory character, and the main objective was to understand the impact of applying a set of activities to 54 children. The objectives of this work were to increase the climate literacy of the children involved—more specifically, to evaluate the impact of implementing three activities related to climate change and identify the knowledge about the cases and consequences of climate change that were acquired by the children involved. To collect the data, we used a focus group technique and content analysis to process it. The results revealed that the children acquired a better understanding of the problem of climate change—in particular, the causes and consequences of it and of the concept of the ecological footprint—as well as motivation to contribute to mitigating the problem. We conclude that the activities proposed could contribute to improving climate literacy, as well as stimulate children’s curiosity and proactivity so that they become citizens capable of exercising their active citizenship.

Creative Thinking in Art and Design Education: A Systematic Review,"This study aims to identify and analyze relevant characteristics associated with creative thinking, particularly in arts and design education. A systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA protocol, utilizing the Scopus database, where 292 studies were retrieved through search strings. From these, 187 studies were selected for the final analysis. The results highlight an emphasis on experiential learning, STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics), and interdisciplinary approaches as prevalent educational methodologies for fostering creative thinking. The identified techniques include interdisciplinary projects, artistic practices, nature-based activities, and the use of digital tools. The core skills identified include originality, fluency, flexibility, and elaboration. Furthermore, it was observed that most of the studies were conducted in higher education institutions. The study underscores the urgency of promoting research in specific regions, such as Latin America, to contribute to advancing and enriching the educational landscape in these areas. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of fostering creativity from an early age. The significance of this study lies in its contribution to more effective pedagogical practices for the development of creative thinking that positively impacts education and prepares individuals for the challenges of the 21st century.

The Role of Second Language Reading Proficiency in Moderating Second Language Word Recognition,"Drawing upon the division of labor between orthographic and phonological information, this study investigated whether and how L2 reading proficiency moderates learners’ reliance on phonological and orthographic information in retrieving word meanings. A total of 136 Chinese collegiate students who learned English as a foreign language (EFL) completed English reading proficiency tests and were divided into higher and lower reading proficiency groups using an extreme-group approach. Behavioral tasks were used to measure the participants’ sensitivity to and processing skills of orthographic and phonological information. The analysis showed that the reliance on phonological and orthographic information differed significantly across L2 reading proficiency groups: The higher reading proficiency group was sensitive to both phonological and orthographic information within words, while the lower reading proficiency group was only sensitive to orthographic information; only orthographic processing skills significantly contributed to the word meaning retrieval of individuals in the higher reading proficiency group, while phonological processing skills were the only predictor for the lower reading proficiency group. These results suggest that the use of phonological and orthographic information vary as a function of L2 learners’ English reading proficiency. Implications regarding the changing patterns of L1 influences and the language-universal and language-specific aspects of word recognition were discussed.

Assessment of Executive Functions in School Considering Motor and Sociodemographic Factors: A Joint Vision for School-Based Occupational Therapists and School Staff,"Executive functions (EFs) and motor skills are essential for many school and daily tasks. Many school-based occupational therapists need help addressing EFs. The current study aims to provide new insights into the relationship between executive functions and motor development by considering confounding factors. Ninety-six second-grade children were tested in one state-funded (public) school and another state-subsidised private school. Children were assessed with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2), Neuropsychological Assessment of Executive Functions in Children, and Test of Perception of Differences–R. Families completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, and teachers completed a previous questionnaire and subsequently evaluated the information the occupational therapist provided. Mixed results were obtained regarding the correlation between motor and executive skills. Furthermore, children who received worse scores on the MABC-2 had more difficulties on the EFs tests. The Impulsivity Control Index was not correlated with any motor variable. Our results show that sociodemographic variables (except gender) correlate more with EFs than motor skills. The teachers showed a high degree of agreement with the occupational therapist (4.0 ± 0.8), even in children with good academic performance. They expressed the need for additional training and classroom interventions. A joint vision of motor-executive functioning can facilitate the design of effective interventions, especially in schools with more disadvantaged populations.

The Work Environment of the School Leader in Australia: The Case for Sustained Change in Role and Practice,"The questions addressed in this essay are (1) how has the work environment of school leaders changed in the early years of the 21st century, (2) how have these changes affected the role of the school leader, (3) what is the association between an evident deterioration in the work environment and the trend to more autonomy for schools and their leaders, and (4) how can school systems be more effective in supporting school leaders? The essay is organised into three domains that emerged from a review of the literature on changes in the work environment: intensification–intimidation, autonomy–accountability and system–support. Six recommendations are derived from the evidence: principals should have greater control over their work environment, system leaders should remove many reporting requirements from schools, there should be “organised abandonment” of outdated practices, the potential benefits of AI should be realised, there should be more engagement in planning for the future, and there should be further research on processes and outcomes through randomised controlled trials of new practices. It is not so much new theories in leadership but rather new roles and new practices within different arrangements for governance, informed by ongoing research as the context changes, amid evidence of deterioration in professional wellbeing.

Teachers’ Experiences of Online/Distance Teaching and Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Mainstream Classrooms with Vulnerable Students in Cyprus,"The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent school lockdowns in many countries forced teachers to deliver lessons online to ensure that students continued their studies. This shift, which caused major challenges for school systems worldwide, significantly affected the Cypriot education system, which is highly centralised and in which teacher-centred practices are widely used. In many countries, teachers and students were unfamiliar with the new teaching and evaluation methods, and learners in the most marginalised groups were deemed to be at risk of falling behind. For these reasons, an online survey was undertaken in Cyprus from March to September 2020 as part of an international online survey initiated by a university in the Northern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon. The survey examined teachers’ perspectives on the new online pedagogical practices; the challenges they faced; and the impact of these practices on the learning progress of all students, including two vulnerable groups, i.e., individuals with learning disabilities and immigrant students aged 6–18 years. Key findings suggest that the teachers were unprepared to design inclusive student-centred digital activities and deliver online lessons and that distance teaching may have negatively affected students’ learning experiences, especially in the vulnerable groups.

The Training of Flamenco Dance Teachers of the Escuela Sevillana (Sevillian School): From Practical Experience to the Practice of Teaching,"Flamenco is a traditional way of expressing values and knowledge from one generation to the next as part of informal education and is now a consolidated artistic genre in Andalusia. A legal framework was created to protect and promote flamenco as a unique element of Andalusian culture, and to incorporate flamenco studies into the official school curriculum. There is nothing written on what constitutes flamenco content or how it should be taught. We conducted a small phenomenological ethnographic study of women who teach a specific style of flamenco dance which is important in the field of teaching, namely the Escuela Sevillana, and we aimed to understand how they constructed the pedagogical content knowledge that enabled them to teach it in the public and private spaces where it is taught. The study design was qualitative and interpretive. The study population comprised all women teaching this style of flamenco dance. Data collection was through in-depth interviews, with a bibliographical review of relevant material for context. The results focus on interpreting and understanding the reality studied, and describing in detail how these dance teachers constructed the pedagogical content knowledge in order to teach it effectively. We draw the conclusions that there are various stages of teaching professionalisation, and experience-based learning is important for consolidation as a teacher.

Lessons from Two Decades of Research about Successful School Leadership in England: A Humanistic Approach,"This paper reviews the research on successful school principalship carried out in England over the last 20 years. Drawing on evidence synthesized from the International Successful School Principalship Project (ISSPP) and related English school leadership research conducted by ISSPP scholars, this review aims to answer a conceptual research question: How do the principalship’s moral purposes and contextual understanding shape the time-sensitive, informed adoption of combinations and accumulations of strategies that lead to sustained school success? This paper identifies five research insights derived from case studies in England and elaborates on the complex, values-led layered web of interactions between the school principal and key stakeholders within and outside the school in the context of frequent social changes and policy interventions in England. Whilst the pace has been greater and more intense than in many other countries, the direction has been, and remains, similar. The body of scholarship here reviewed engages with national policies as filtered and then enacted by successful principals. While ‘effective’ principals lead to students’ success as measured by performance on national tests and examinations, our focus is upon an empirically founded definition of ‘successful’ school leadership that is located in complexity theory and encompasses the enactment of the core purposes of education that include but go beyond the functional. In doing so, it avoids ‘what to do’ formulae and the limitations of certain theoretical ‘leadership’ models, finding that successful school leaders’ work embodies a broader humanistic view of student learning and achievement, which implies the preordinance of the personal over the functional. Taken together, these research insights contribute to the ISSPP’s continued effort to refine and advance the knowledge base of successful school leadership within and across different countries.

"Exploring the Gender Gap: Motivation, Procrastination, Environment, and Academic Performance in an Introductory Physics Course in a Human-Centered Private University in Northeast Mexico—A Case Study","Progress has been made in recent decades toward achieving gender equality, but today, the gender gap is still noticeable, especially in STEM fields. In support of Goal 5 of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda: achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, we analyze the context of a private university in northeastern Mexico using a sample of 249 students (157 males and 92 females) enrolled in the first-year engineering course Physics I. The sample presents better academic performance in favor of women by the end of the course as reported through the final course score (F); thus, we explore potential gender differences in student profiles, such as their motivation and level of procrastination using Kruskal–Wallis correlation tests, and measuring the effect size with Cohen’s d. Our tests reported here reveal significant differences in extrinsic motivation (EMO) and intrinsic motivation (IMO), where females obtained higher means in IMO, while males reported higher levels of procrastination (PRO). Contrary to other cases in the literature, the sample presents better academic performance in favor of women. Our findings here aim to encourage programs and strategies that strengthen women’s intrinsic motivation to support women’s empowerment and keep reducing the gender gap.

Learning the Practice from the Practice: Theory–Practice Courses in Teacher Education,"In teacher education programs, it is important to deepen knowledge alongside developing practices through practical experience. One practice of the Professional Development School’s (PDS) model in clinical experience is designing courses linking theory to practice. The present study examines the perception of the administrative officers in colleges of education in Israel regarding the Ministry of Education’s Theory–Practice (TP) courses and the challenges in implementing them in the curriculum. This study was conducted in 16 state academic colleges for education and 37 administrative personnel participated: presidents, vice presidents, rectors, deans, and heads of courses and practical training. A semi-structured interview was used, and the data was analyzed thematically. The research participants believe that TP courses as a tool implemented as part of the PDS model may be effective in training teachers to integrate theory with practical experience. The participants raised three major challenges to implementation: systemic, pedagogical, and organizational. The participants emphasize that designing and implementing TP courses is a complex, slow process requiring organizational change and the mindset of administration and teaching staff at both the colleges of education and the schools. Long-term assessment is required to examine the effect of reducing hours dedicated to education theory and subject knowledge.

Examining Teacher Attrition through the Experiences of Former Teachers before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Schools across the nation are impacted by the influx of teachers leaving the profession. Record-high teacher shortages devastate public schools as classrooms remain unstaffed, and students miss quality instruction. The current study examined the experiences of former teachers before and during the COVID-19 pandemic that led to their exit from the profession. The overall research question was, “What experiences led teachers to exit the profession before and during the COVID-19 pandemic?” Using Maslach’s Burnout Theory as a guiding framework, qualitative data were collected during 10 in-depth interviews with former educators. Ten participants were selected using purposive sampling for interviews. The following criteria were utilized to select participants for interviews: taught in a South Carolina public school for at least eight years, taught during the pandemic, and quit or retired early. Potential limitations that were identified for the study included a limited number of participants, the emotional distress of reliving leaving the teaching profession, and the utilization of a virtual platform to conduct interviews. Data analyses resulted in the following themes contributing to teacher attrition: Lack of support from the administration, lack of professional autonomy, and increased stress. These were the most consistent themes noted before and during the pandemic. This research study provides educational leaders and policy makers with the voices of teachers who have left the profession, thus providing valuable data to make informed decisions in an effort to reverse the current teacher attrition trend. The determinants of teacher shortage identified in the data analysis of this phenomenological study can be addressed immediately within individual schools to help resolve the teacher shortage. Recommendations for future practice include administrators developing trusting relationships with teachers as well as educational leaders providing educators with a voice in decisions that affect their classrooms.

Investigating the Factors Contributing to the Formation of Secondary School Students’ Interest towards Higher Education Studies,"The present study’s objective constitutes the examination of the prognostic factors that influence the inclination of students in secondary school towards pursuing higher education. To achieve this goal, an existing questionnaire was utilized and appropriately altered to align with the Greek educational system. The survey involved the participation of 301 secondary school students from Piraeus, which comprises one of Greece’s major cities. The outcomes of the research yield substantial endorsement for the principles outlined in the social cognitive career theory. Specifically, the study highlights the significant role of family background, encompassing the educational levels of the parents, the students’ perceptions of the family’s financial situation, and the financial support provided by the family during the students’ academic journey, in shaping the students’ intent towards pursuing higher education. Moreover, the presence of a secure attachment bond between students and their parents suggests a favorable inclination towards higher education. Conversely, students deriving from low-income families are prone to exhibit hesitancy in pursuing higher education. The acquired data reveal a constructive relationship among outcome expectations, social support, as well as the process of students’ interest in developing a desire for higher education. Conversely, factors such as gender and age, as well as the presence of siblings studying in higher education, appear to have little influence in this regard.

Culturally Relevant STEM (CReST): An Integrated Support Curriculum for High School Chemistry and World History,"Convergence education, driven by compelling or complex socio-scientific problems, is an approach to bring cultural relevance into secondary STEM education. National trends show the need to increase the STEM workforce by leveraging educational research and innovative practices within the secondary level to increase student interest prior to graduating high school. We introduced CReST (Culturally Relevant STEM) in a US high school pilot study. Student participants included 276 Chemistry students and 19 World History I students. The study also engaged four (4) high school teachers in chemistry and social studies with the challenge of cultural heritage conservation through the lens of the (physicochemical) life cycle of mural paintings in Europe. Teachers were provided with (1) professional development; (2) a digital curriculum; and (3) modular kits for hands-on learning. The research focused qualitatively on the experiences from the teacher and students as well as quantitatively to assess whether there was an increase in student academic performance. We found a statistically significant gain with respect to Chemistry (4.0%) and World History (13.4%) content. Students and teachers responded with overwhelming positivity in individual and focus-group interviews. This amplifies the further need of convergent educational approaches in high school STEM education to enhance engagement and increase student learning.

The Effects of Teacher-Centered and Student-Centered Approaches in TOEIC Reading Instruction,"Teacher-centered instruction is prevalent in preparation courses for large-scale standardized language tests. Student-centered instruction, while known to be effective in enhancing communicative competence, has been considered ineffective and time-consuming to implement in preparation courses for large-scale standardized language tests. To investigate this assumption, a quasi-experimental study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of two teaching approaches— teacher-centered and Jigsaw—on students’ Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) Reading Comprehension Part Seven scores. The results showed that both groups experienced significant improvements from the pre-test to the post-test in their overall performance; however, there was no statistically significant difference between them. Furthermore, students in the Jigsaw group showed statistically significant improvements in all three passage types (single, double, and triple), while students in the teacher-centered group showed insignificant improvement in one of the three passage types (single passages). These findings suggest that both teaching approaches can effectively improve students’ TOEIC Reading Comprehension scores. The study adds to the body of research on teaching approaches in EFL TOEIC Reading Comprehension university classrooms. The findings suggest that teacher-centered and student-centered approaches can effectively improve students’ TOEIC Reading Comprehension scores.

Chinese Students Learning English as a Second Language,"The way in which different cities teach children to read in Chinese may have an impact on the skills they later utilize to acquire English word reading skills. This study examined the relative contributions of several cognitive–linguistic measures to English word reading for Chinese students learning English as a second language in two Chinese cities, one whose school system teaches Pinyin (Beijing) and one whose school system does not teach Pinyin (Hong Kong). Students in grades 2–3 completed measures on Chinese morphological awareness (MA), Chinese phonological awareness (PA), Pinyin writing, and English word reading. In the Beijing group, it was found that PA (β = 0.334, p < 0.01) and Pinyin (β = 0.257, p < 0.05) were significant predictors of English word reading. In contrast, in the Hong Kong group, only MA (β = 0.263, p < 0.05) was found to be a significant predictor of English word reading. The difference in predictors could be due to the availability of a phonological tool (Pinyin) for the Beijing students when learning Chinese, while the Hong Kong group may have relied more heavily on learning using MA and rote memory techniques. Overall, the results from this study provide data supporting the benefits of having a phonological tool like Pinyin for Chinese children when learning to read in English.

"International Partnerships in University-Level Music Education: Principles, Pivots, and Possibilities","This article reports an analytical review of research and policy concerning the qualities that create, sustain, and enliven academic partnerships between universities in different countries. This review provides context for a discussion of the development of the institutional partnership between the Universität Mozarteum Salzburg (Austria) and Georgia State University (United States of America). A scoping review of the literature suggests that such partnerships are viewed differently by those responsible for the legal agreement establishing the partnership, the faculty and students who are tasked with implementing the partnership, and outsiders who view the results of the partnership via publications, presentations, and performances. This review situates the analysis of the partnership with the identification of themes consistent with the broader literature, including a reflection on cultural awareness, access and equity, institutional and human capacity building, and ethical dilemmas. Implications include a reflection on the collaboration’s COVID-19 era development, with the suggestion that the shift to virtual communication enhanced the partnership even as it disrupted the planned implementation.

Effects of Gender and Age Interaction on Sense of Coherence and Subjective Well-Being of Senior High School Students in Northern Ghana,"Though several studies have established the effect of gender and age on the sense of coherence (SoC) and subjective well-being (SWB) among diverse populations, findings have been varied and inconclusive. These inconsistencies have been attributed to the differences in sample characteristics, methodological and cultural disparities. Thus, the present study assessed the following: (1) gender and age effect on SoC, (2) gender and age effect on SWB, and (3) moderating roles of gender and age in the link between SoC and SWB. Through a stratified sampling technique, 724 selected high school students from secondary schools in Northern Ghana completed the World Health Organization-5 Well-Being and Sense of Coherence instruments. The results showed that female students exhibited higher levels of SoC compared to their male counterparts. Whereas younger male and female students showed no significant difference in SWB levels, older female students, compared to older males, exhibited high levels of SWB. Age significantly moderated the relationship between SoC and SWB. With the same level of SoC, younger students were more likely to exhibit higher SWB compared to older ones. The findings call for sustainable gender- and age-based interventions because students subjectively develop SoC mechanisms for improving their well-being.

Metaphors in Educational Videos,"Traditionally, metaphors have been used as a pedagogical tool to facilitate the processes of educational mediation. From a medial perspective, there are various ways to implement educational mediation, and currently, we are witnessing an increase in the use of videos. Given the historical pedagogical role of metaphor and the widespread use of videos, we expected to find a significant amount of the scientific literature exploring metaphors in educational videos. However, studies establishing a direct connection are rare. Motivated by this gap, we decided to present users with a metaphorical educational video, intending to observe and analyze, through a phenomenological approach, how the metaphor is perceived by users. To gather data on users’ experience, we applied the think-aloud protocol during video consumption and then we conducted semi-structured interviews. Subsequently, we analyzed the collected data using phenomenological procedures. Our results highlighted that the use of metaphor can stimulate engagement and facilitate the educational mediation, as long as the metaphor is shared and perceived as coherent by users. Finally, we have highlighted some distinctive aspects of using metaphor in educational videos, such as the ability to visually represent metaphors, create metaphorical contexts, and reinforce the processes of embodied simulation that occur during video viewing.

The Evolving Classroom: How Learning Analytics Is Shaping the Future of Education and Feedback Mechanisms,"In the dynamic world of higher education, technological advancements are continually reshaping teaching and learning approaches, with learning analytics (LA) playing a crucial role in this transformation. This systematic literature review (SLR) explores the significant impact of LA in higher education, specifically its transformative role in personalizing and enhancing educational feedback mechanisms. Utilizing a wide range of educational data, LA facilitates a shift from generic to individualized feedback, leading to improved learning outcomes and equity. However, incorporating LA into higher education is not without challenges, ranging from data privacy concerns to the possibility of algorithmic errors. Addressing these challenges is vital for unlocking the full potential of LA. This paper also examines emerging LA trends, such as augmented reality, emotion-sensing technology, and predictive analytics, which promise to further personalize learning experiences in higher education settings. By anchoring these advancements within core educational principles, we foresee a future of education marked by innovation and diversity. This SLR provides an overview of LA’s evolution in higher education, highlighting its transformative power, acknowledging its challenges, and anticipating its future role in shaping a dynamic, responsive educational environment.

Beyond Legal Constraints: Understanding Barriers to Humanizing Responses in the Aftermath of Hate Speech at Private Universities,"Supreme Court rulings prevent public institutions from censoring hate speech for content—even if that content has damaging consequences for marginalized students and conflicts with other institutional objectives. This case study examines administrator responses to hate speech and impacts for racial inclusion at a private university unconstrained by First Amendment protections. The findings illustrate that, even in contexts where administrators have both the constitutional leeway to enact stricter speech policies and a deep investment in building an anti-racist community, normative understandings about freedom of expression hamper efforts for racial inclusion and humanizing responses. We propose an “inclusive freedom” approach that leverages norms of academic freedom as a path forward for postsecondary institutions to address harm in the aftermath of hate speech.

Revitalizing Sustainability in Mathematics Education: The Case of the New Norwegian Curriculum,"This paper aims to discuss the revitalization of education for sustainable development (ESD) in mathematics education, particularly in relation to mathematics curricula for grades 1–10, using the example of the new Norwegian curriculum, LK20, which came into effect at the beginning of the 2020 school year. Several studies in the past two decades have identified disengagement of sustainability learning (SL) within mathematics education and called for a change in the philosophy of mathematics education to integrate sustainability into the teaching and learning of mathematics. Using the qualitative content analysis method, we examined three types of documents: the core curriculum, the mathematics curriculum, and one Norwegian mathematics textbook series called Matemagisk. We find that sustainable development (SD) is one of the interdisciplinary issues addressed in LK20. Even though the mathematics curriculum does not explicitly incorporate terms such as ‘sustainability’ or ‘sustainable development’, indicating that mathematics and sustainability are unconnected, its six core elements—exploration and problem-solving, modeling and applications, reasoning and argumentation, representation and communication, abstraction and generalization, and mathematical fields of knowledge—provide opportunities for integrating sustainability learning (SL). On the other hand, looking at one of the mathematics textbook series, Matemagisk, for grades 4, 7, and 10, it appears that tasks that use sustainability contexts were included implicitly or explicitly, indicating another opportunity to facilitate sustainable learning. By including sustainability contexts in tasks and mathematical activities, it is possible to boost the process of embedding ESD in mathematics education without compromising content.

Quality of Life of Children from Families Affected by Migration: The Role of Educational Policies,"The problems of children from Romanian transnational families represent a current issue and one of great interest in the field of public policies that need to be developed in Romania in order to offer solutions that will lead to an increase in the quality of life within these families. This article reflects, based on the results of a survey among parents/grandparents who care for children from transnational families and two focus groups with authorities/organizations with a role in managing the problems of transnational families, the main issues faced by children from these families within education. The results obtained indicate an increased need for intervention in the following areas: support to avoid school dropout; education regarding the negative effects of drug, alcohol and other toxic substance consumption; and supervision in the completion of school assignments. All these problems influence the educational course of children and consequently the quality of life of all family members. This article offers support to decision makers in the field of educational policies to effectively manage the real problems of these families, highlighting the vital role of substantiating public policies based on scientific studies.

Mathematical Anxiety among Primary Education Degree Students in the Post-Pandemic Era: A Case Study,"The study of the affective domain has grown in relevance ever since educators and researchers showed its influence in the process of teaching and learning, playing a fundamental role in the evolution of student learning. Anxiety is one component of the affective domain. The study of mathematical anxiety in pre-service primary teachers at university is the focus of this study. We analyse mathematical anxiety by examining specific data from the sample (age, gender, the subjects they studied in upper-secondary education, and academic performance). One hundred and nineteen students from the Primary Education degree completed the mathematical anxiety questionnaire, obtaining an average anxiety score considered negative (3.08 above the neutral value of 3). The results show a high anxiety toward examinations (3.68) and a negative relation with academic performance. Furthermore, the results show that women, 19-year-old university students, and those from a humanities-based upper-secondary education present greater levels of anxiety than men, older students, or students from other areas of upper-secondary education, respectively. All values of mathematical anxiety are higher than pre-pandemic levels. We can conclude from the studied sample that the students show low–medium global anxiety over mathematics, medium anxiety over problem solving, and high anxiety about exams.

The Future Orientation of Italian Adolescents in Post-Pandemic Times: Associations with Self-Efficacy and Perceived Academic Achievement,"Future orientation refers to an individual’s conscious portrayal of upcoming events, encompassing thoughts, motivations, and emotions. Research on future orientation has primarily focused on adolescents due to their perceived necessity to prepare for adulthood. To investigate the hopes and fears of Italian adolescents in post-pandemic times, as well as age and gender differences and the associations between future orientation, self-efficacy, and perceived academic achievement, a survey was conducted with 388 Italian high school students. The Future Orientation and Life Course Prospective Questionnaires, along with the Problem-Solving Self-Efficacy Scale, were administered. Data analysis involved content analysis of hopes and fears, as well as statistical methods (t-tests, Pearson’s correlation coefficients, and multiple regression analysis) were employed. A greater number of fears than hopes were mentioned. Age differences were marginal. Compared with males, females expressed a greater number of hopes and fears and provided more detailed insights into their fears within the domains of higher education, self, and the general existential category. As expected, positive and modest correlations were observed between future orientation, self-efficacy, and academic achievement. Notably, self-efficacy and work/career future orientation were found to predict academic achievement. The results are discussed in terms of their relevance for school educational programs.

Making Experts: The Boundary Crossing of Knowledge and the Emergence of Relational Expertise in a School Makerspace,"Existing research has illuminated the multidimensional nature of knowledge creation in school makerspaces. Yet, limited research exists on the boundary crossing of knowledge in makerspaces and how it can lead to the emergence of relational expertise. Using video records of interactions between 10–13-year-old students and their teachers in a school makerspace, this ethnographic case study applied mediated discourse analysis to investigate the boundary crossing of knowledge and the emergence of relational expertise—i.e., engaging with one’s own expertise, while recognizing, responding to, and building on others’ expertise. The results demonstrate how relational expertise emerged through boundary crossing of knowledge, with increased opportunities for students to identify themselves as experts. The boundary crossing of knowledge was mediated by participating students and teachers as well as material objects, evidencing the social and material nature of relational expertise in the makerspace. By recognizing the makerspace as a boundary object and an epistemic tool, the study enhances current understanding of the boundary crossing of knowledge and the emergence of relational expertise within creative and digitally enhanced learning environments.

Undergraduate Students’ Engagement in Project-Based Learning with an Authentic Context,"Despite the widespread adoption of project-based learning in higher education, few empirical studies have explored its impact on situating learners within real-world contexts and enhancing student engagement. This study situates undergraduates in a technology integration course in an authentic context to increase the levels of engagement of the students. The project, requested by real-world clients from an elementary school, enabled students to develop learning resources around topics in need that aligned with state standards. We expected students engaged with real-world clients to demonstrate higher levels of behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement compared to those involved in non-real-world context projects. The results of our mixed-methods research revealed increased student engagement with an authentic, real-world context compared to a non-real-world context. The integration of real-world context not only heightened student involvement in the project and strengthened group dynamics but also facilitated a deeper understanding of technology integration and service learning. Implications for future research are also discussed.

Cooperating Teachers’ Perceptions and Contributions to Preservice Teachers’ Professional Identities,"Research on teachers’ socialisation years after they begin teaching in schools has not been extensively undertaken, and there are significant long-term consequences for how these experiences in organisational socialisation influence the quality of physical education programs. The purpose of this study was to determine how cooperating teachers perceive their role in the development of preservice physical education teachers’ professional identities. We used a qualitative methodology, gathering data through semi-structured interviews. Seven cooperating physical education teachers (five female and two male) with between 22 and 40 years of service were interviewed. The data were analysed through thematic content analysis using a constant comparative modality. The interview questions were categorised into three themes: reasons for being a cooperating teacher, the role of the cooperating teacher, and the professional identity of the cooperating teacher. The findings suggest various interpretations of the cooperating teacher’s role and ways of working. The most important skills to have in order to be a cooperating teacher appear to be related to how they were socialised and how they continue to experience the socialisation process during organisational socialisation, as well as the career phase in which they currently find themselves.

The Quality of Early Childhood Curricula and Distributed Leadership in Lithuanian ECEC Institutions,"The early childhood curriculum is an integral part of the educational process, and many countries are looking at how to ensure its quality. With the decentralization of educational content in Lithuania, each Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) institution develops its own curriculum. In this case, the role of the head teacher at school and the leadership style they adopt become very important. Our study aims to investigate the expression of shared leadership in Lithuanian preschool education institutions and how it relates to the curriculum quality. An online survey was conducted in spring–autumn 2023. The sample was randomly selected from a list of kindergartens (N = 549) operating in Lithuania, and 133 kindergartens were selected. Of these, 79 (59.4%) institutions responded and agreed to participate. The research sample comprised 461 early childhood educators. The analysis of the survey data showed that distributed leadership can explain 61.3% of the quality of the curriculum. This means that if there is a higher degree of distributed leadership in the early childhood education community, the quality of the ECEC curriculum will likely be higher. ECEC leaders should pay attention to the individual scales of distributed leadership, collaboration, and cooperation.

The Grass Ceiling: Hidden Educational Barriers in Rural England,"Rurality is rarely integrated into analyses of educational inequalities and this article presents an alternative perspective on rural–urban attainment and highlights the impact of rurality on educational outcomes. The traditional narrative of urban–rural educational disadvantage is that urban pupils do less well in the English exam system. Decontextualised data across different English exam performance measures demonstrate how rural pupils outperform their urban counterparts. Socioeconomic disadvantage (SED) has the most significant impact on attainment and this analysis explores the rural–urban attainment gap through this SED lens. An analysis of the Department for Education (DfE) data explores possible factors that might explain the emerging rural educational gap and presents an argument that rurality is another limiting factor that intersects with SED. This article demonstrates how rural underachievement in England has been hidden by the relative sizes and SED distribution of rural and urban populations.

Teacher Professional Development in Integrated STEAM Education: A Study on Its Contribution to the Development of the PCK of Physics Teachers,"Integrated STEM education (iSTEM) has attracted attention due to its potentialities regarding students’ learning and intentions to pursue STEM-related careers. However, although increasingly popular, iSTEM remains challenging and elusive, particularly from teachers’ perspective. This scenario became even more complex with the inclusion of “A”, from the Arts. Considering that the quality of teachers is decisive in the success of integrated STEAM education (iSTEAM), it is essential to provide teachers with opportunities to develop their Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) for iSTEAM. In this work, the aim was to understand the effect of teacher professional development (TPD) within iSTEAM on the development of Physics teachers’ PCK related to the topic of “Electrical circuits with associations in series and parallel”. This study followed a pre-test/post-test design with a single group, which facilitates the subsequent comparison of participants’ reported PCK before and after their involvement in the TPD. The results showed that the TPD had a favorable impact on teachers’ PCK. The results of this study also contribute to defining a specific PCK for STEAM (STEAM-PCK).

"Teacher Victimization by Students, Their Parents, and School Staff: Prevalence and Links with Teachers’ Life Satisfaction in a Lithuanian Sample","The links between different forms of teacher victimization and teachers’ life satisfaction are still under-researched. To highlight teacher victimization by various parties within the school environment and its associations with teachers’ life satisfaction, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, the Multidimensional Teacher Victimization Scale, and some additional measures were applied. The findings based on a Lithuanian sample (n = 1146) revealed that a significant portion of teachers have experienced victimization in various forms: 38.5% of teachers have been bullied by school staff, 33.9% have faced verbal victimization from students’ parents, and victimization by students affected 65.8% of teachers, with verbal and social victimization being the most common. An SEM analysis (χ2 = 355.787; Df = 33; CFI = 0.928; TLI = 0.902; NFI = 0.922; RMSEA = 0.092 [0.084–0.101]; SRMR = 0.0432) revealed that bullying by staff is not only detrimental in its own right but also relates positively to other forms of victimization, including verbal victimization by parents and multidimensional victimization by students, as teacher victimization by students and their parents mediated the relationship between teacher victimization by school staff and teacher life satisfaction. The findings suggest a complex problem within the school environment where different forms of victimization are interconnected and call for urgent attention and action from educational policymakers and school administrators to address and mitigate teacher victimization.

“Research Mentors Should Support Students of Color by Taking an Extra Step.” Undergraduates’ Reasoning about Race and STEM Research Mentorship,"Racial inequities and the adoption of a colorblind approach in education contribute to a situation wherein many academics lack the personal experience and incentive needed to identify and confront racism within society and institutions. This may be particularly the case in fields related to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), which tend to have lower levels of diversity compared to other fields. The current study examines undergraduates’ perceptions of whether STEM research mentors should consider race when mentoring students from marginalized backgrounds. We employ a mixed-methods approach with the goal of uncovering how undergraduate students perceive and rationalize research mentoring practices. Findings reveal that a strong majority of undergraduate students believe that research mentors should take race into account when mentoring students from marginalized backgrounds. During the qualitative coding process, the research team unearthed seven overarching themes that outline undergraduates’ reasoning, both in favor and against STEM research mentors considering race. We conclude by presenting an intervention intended to motivate individuals to redress colorblind ideologies and thus support a culturally sensitive mentoring style.

Using Critical Social Theory as Professional Learning to Develop Scholar—Practitioners in Physical Education: The Example of Bourdieu’s Theory of Practice,"In this conceptual article, we present the idea that the physical education (PE) teacher is, out of professional necessity, a scholar—practitioner. To substantiate and evolve this idea, we develop a Deweyian pragmatist view of the scholar—practitioner which also embraces criticality. This stance collapses the binary notion of theory and practice and instead embraces theory and practice as a duality. We add a critical dimension to this duality through recognising that scholar—practitioners (especially leaders) require criticality and cultural awareness to raise questions over knowledge conventions and the mitigations of contextual factors their learners may face. We then turn to the critical and practical sociology of Pierre Bourdieu to illustrate how the use of theory may help PE scholar—practitioners enhance their criticality and cultural awareness. More specifically, we draw on Bourdieu’s primary concepts of field, capital and habitus to show how the application of this theory can help PE scholar—practitioners position themselves in relation to their profession and how they might know their field; be aware of their, and their students’, capital worth in relation to that field; and know themselves (their personal—professional habitus). In conclusion, we suggest that for PE scholar—practitioners, theory-based learning and its applied use might be considered a form of professional learning and not be limited to Bourdieu’s theory but extended to include a range of other aspects of critical social theory. We finish by suggesting that this approach to the PE scholar—practitioner is even more pertinent due to the field of PE becoming increasingly a third space—something which requires additional research and analysis.

Cognitive Control among Primary- and Middle-School Students and Their Associations with Math Achievement,"Background: Math achievement is an important predictor of academic success. While many studies have examined math achievement in young children, studies with older children are scarce. This study focused on primary- and middle-school students, examining math achievements and cognitive control. Cognitive control was assessed referring to both domain-specific and domain-general cognitive control mechanisms and eliciting both simple and complex levels of conflict, and their association with math achievements. Methods: One-hundred-and-twenty-two participants performed two versions of a cognitive control task: a numerical Stroop task (NST; manipulating the numerical and physical size of Arabic numerals) and a perceptual Stroop task (PST; manipulating the location and direction of an arrow). For math achievements, participants performed math fluency and math curriculum tests. Results: Overall, the congruency effect was smaller in older students than in younger ones. Moreover, all participants demonstrated a similar congruency effect in the simple conflict task, whereas younger students showed a larger congruency effect in the complex conflict task. In addition, performance on the basic math fluency task was predicted by both Stroop tasks. However, performance on the comprehensive math achievement test was predicted only by the PST. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated enhanced cognitive control abilities of middle-school students and suggest that they can contribute to math achievements. We call for considering the implementation of both domain-specific and domain-general cognitive control activities as a potential approach to support math achievements.

Bracing Ourselves: Embracing Policy Changes through a Long-Standing University–Schools Teacher Education Partnership in England,"We articulate the principles behind our practices as teacher educators for an Initial Teacher Education (ITE) provider in South-West England working in partnership with local schools. We position them as ‘braces’ that enable us not only to withstand but ‘embrace’ the challenges of the current policy environment, which imposes braces of its own. All ITE providers in England must present their curriculum and teaching plans for approval by the Department for Education, one of many significant changes to ITE required in England over the last decade. Furthermore, for such plans to be approved they must assume a model of schooling based on knowledge acquisition in tension with not only our own motivations but also a broader (global) conversation among teacher educators critical of policy priorities for schooling and professional teacher formation that prioritise success in high-stakes tests and international league tables. The braces/principles emerge through articulating our collective understandings of and concerns with the policy braces. Our principles connect to the processes we feel confident are necessary aspects of ‘becoming’ teachers and can hold our Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) together, going forwards. The braces—becoming an informed educator; becoming an ethical actor; becoming a reflective practitioner—have a distinctive form of reflexivity at their heart and should apply to everyone across our partnership: us, as university-based teacher educators; school-based colleagues; and pre-service teachers. We offer our approach and the braces/principles we have developed to others also struggling to reconcile their own notions of good teacher education with national policy imperatives.

Implementation of Biotechnology Applied to Medicine Course Using Virtual Laboratories: Perceptions and Attitudes of Students,"The rapid evolution of biotechnology across various sectors, including agriculture, industry, and medicine, has profoundly transformed our comprehension of the world. Virtual laboratories (VLs) provide an immersive learning experience that can enhance future generations’ understanding of biotechnology’s medical applications. This study investigated the impact of incorporating VLs into a short course on biotechnology applied to medicine on the attitudes and perceptions of third-year medical students (n = 210). A validated questionnaire was employed to assess their perspectives, attitudes, and experience with virtual laboratory platforms before and after the course. The findings revealed a significant positive change in 7/38 questionnaire items (p < 0.05), indicating that the VL experience modified perceptions about biotechnology. This study emphasizes the importance of exploring innovative teaching methods for biotechnology and highlights the advantages of VL in educating future physicians. The primary concerns of the students were the misuse of personal genetic information and biotechnological applications involving animal modification. Overall, the students had a favorable experience using the virtual laboratory platforms. These findings collectively suggest that VL can positively influence perceptions and attitudes toward biotechnology among healthcare professionals.

"Emotionally Based School Avoidance in the Aftermath of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Neurodiversity, Agency and Belonging in School","Lockdowns at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic led to extended school closures globally, and in many countries school attendance has not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. In England, education leaders have expressed concern both about increased anxiety among pupils and chronic absenteeism post-pandemic, against a backdrop of over a decade of increasing mental health need among children and young people. This article presents a narrative review with the aims of (a) conceptualising emotionally based school avoidance (EBSA), and (b) identifying strategies for supporting children and young people experiencing psychological barriers to attending school. The underlying reasons for school being experienced as a hostile environment by a minority of pupils are explored, with research findings specifically relating to the school experiences of neurodivergent pupils in mainstream settings included as an illustrative example. The psychological constructs of belongingness and agency are discussed as potential mechanisms of change. Finally, psychologically informed strategies to address EBSA are reviewed, drawing on the framework of multiple systems of support. To reduce absenteeism in pupils experiencing EBSA, and thus avoid exacerbating educational inequalities in disadvantaged groups, it is essential to understand psychological barriers to school attendance and to work collaboratively and compassionately with pupils and families towards solutions.

Forgiveness Education from an Aristotelian Realist Perspective: Can We Determine a Good Forgiveness Education Program?,"If there is no Essence of forgiveness that cuts across many religious and philosophical traditions, forgiveness psychology becomes a cultural product with no implications beyond our confined time and space. In this article, we discuss forgiveness as a moral virtue from an Aristotelian realist perspective. We first attempt to define the Essence of forgiveness that centers on beneficence that develops within and flows to others for their good. We also discuss essential components of forgiveness that should be well captured in a good forgiveness education program. Then, we present two approaches to forgiveness education, the process- and story-based approaches, and show how they provide good applications of the Essence of forgiveness with specific qualities that cannot be reduced to its parts or confused with its Accidents or Properties. Finally, we provide practical implications with a focus on how cultural applications of the approaches presented are compatible with an Aristotelian realist view of forgiveness and, in fact, enrich the practice of forgiveness.

Problem-Based Learning versus Traditional Learning in Physics Education for Engineering Program Students,"Problem-based learning (PBL) is an educational method which involves learning by solving real problems. However, applying a PBL approach to engineering subjects in some cases became a challenging issue. Thus, it is important to determine the best ways in which engineering students can learn physics more effectively and solve problems relevant to their daily lives. The main aim of this study was to compare the final assessment grades in a physics course for students in the engineering program using PBL and traditional learning (TL) methods. The advantages and disadvantages of PBL and TL methods from the practical experience of lecturers are also presented. The study presented data of 460 first-year engineering students taking the physics course at Kaunas University of Technology. The information presented in this study is based on the insights, observations, and individual experiences of the authors as teaching staff. The results indicated that the application of the PBL method allows for enhancement in the teamwork, presentation, and critical thinking skills in physics. However, the TL method promotes the individual learning skills and wider theoretical knowledge in physics of students and is more suitable when the exam only includes closed-ended questions.

Assessing the Linguistic Creativity Domain of Last-Year Compulsory Secondary School Students,"The importance of creativity in the training of people gained special relevance with the PISA Tests of the OECD, which, for the first time, evaluated the general creativity of 15-year-old students in 2022. This descriptive and quantitative study focuses on the evaluation of linguistic creativity, using different classical instruments to measure divergent thinking and adding new ones, such as metaphorical capacity. Participants were 454 students in their last year of secondary education from eight Spanish educational centers. Results indicate moderate performance in divergent thinking tasks, with students exhibiting limitations in generating novel metaphors, often resorting to literal responses. Statistically significant differences according to gender were found in metaphor generation and in the alternate uses task. A correlation study reveals significant associations between metaphor generation and divergent thinking tasks. These highlight the differential role of semantic memory and cognitive processes involved in metaphor generation and divergent thinking. Finally, this study underlines the complexities and multicomponent nature of creativity as a first step to develop educational policies and interventions targeting creativity. Overall, the importance of addressing creativity in a transdisciplinary way and training teachers on techniques to channel creativity are highlighted, such as through the design of challenges or writing workshops.

Exploring Stress Factors and Coping Strategies in Italian Teachers after COVID-19: Evidence from Qualitative Data,"Teaching is a mentally and physically demanding profession that can be a source of stress and burnout. The COVID-19 pandemic put further pressure on teachers who had to face sudden challenges, such as online teaching and difficulties in holding students’ attention in virtual environments. Research has demonstrated that the negative effects of stress factors on teachers’ wellbeing can be modulated by coping strategies. This work explores the main sources of stress that jeopardized Italian teachers’ wellbeing after the COVID-19 pandemic and the coping strategies that they adopted. Eighty-six teachers, belonging to five school institutes located in Northern Italy, took part in three semi-structured group interviews, where their perceptions about wellbeing at school and occupational stress experiences were explored. Furthermore, they completed a survey with questions about recent stressful life events and the coping strategies that they had adopted in the last month. A thematic analysis revealed stressors related to four themes: adverse work conditions, a lack of support (from both school administrators and families), precariousness, and a demanding school system. A total of 22% of teachers experienced stressful events in the last month (e.g., health problems and loss), and 30% reported that they had adopted coping strategies, especially emotion-focused ones. The findings may drive educational policies to enhance protective factors for teachers’ professional wellbeing at school by reinforcing their individual resources and coping strategies, which can help them deal with challenging situations.

Gifted Students’ Actualization of a Rich Task’s Mathematical Potential When Working in Small Groups,"This article examines gifted students’ (ages 13–16) groupwork on a rich task in mathematics. This study was conducted in Norway, which has an inclusive education system that does not allow fixed-ability grouping. The purpose of this study was to better understand how to cultivate mathematical learning opportunities for gifted learners in inclusive education systems. The analysis was conducted from a multimodal perspective, in which students’ coordination of speech, gestures, and artifact use was viewed as part of their learning process. The findings contribute to discussions on gifted students as a heterogeneous group. Moreover, our analysis illustrates how giftedness can be invisible, leading to unrealized potential and low achievement. We suggest that more attention be paid to teaching by adapting to gifted students’ individual needs, particularly if the intention is to provide high-quality learning opportunities for gifted students in inclusive settings.

Level of Satisfaction with the Application of the Collaborative Model of the Flipped Classroom in the Sport of Sailing,"The aim of this study was to assess student satisfaction levels when implementing the collaborative flipped classroom learning model in sailing-sports-related content. The sample consisted of eighty second-year students (21.9 ± 4 years old) pursuing a degree in Physical Activity and Sports Sciences. To evaluate student satisfaction levels, a validated self-assessment questionnaire was administered following completion of the various workshops. The language used was formal, objective, and clear, without biased or ornamental language. The survey comprised six questions, three of which were in the Likert format and three in the dichotomous format. These questions explored students’ viewpoints on participation, usefulness, and satisfaction regarding the implementation of this pedagogical approach. The findings indicate a significant degree of satisfaction and usefulness associated with the employment of this model for teaching sailing sports content. Moreover, students demonstrated a strong sense of engagement with their peers. The implementation of the flipped classroom teaching model among higher education students enhances their satisfaction levels while acquiring knowledge on sailing sports content.

Perspectives of Distance Learning Students on How to Transform Their Computing Curriculum: “Is There Anything to Be Decolonised?”,"Recent years have seen a growing momentum within UK Higher Education institutions to examine the colonial legacy entanglements of teaching materials and knowledge production, as institutions explore what it means to ‘decolonise the curriculum’. While the movement began in the University of Cape Town, South Africa, in response to a student call for the statue of Cecil Rhodes to be removed, elsewhere this has become a top-down imperative from institutions themselves. In 2014 University College London hosted a panel discussion ‘Why Isn’t My Professor Black’ building on the previous year’s video asking, ‘Why is my curriculum white’. By 2020 the #BlackLivesMatter movement once again illuminated the need to rebalance the power of who decides the ‘facts’ with a call for a transformation of knowledge production. Arts and Humanities curricula have been more easily adapted in response to this call, but the argument for decolonisation of STEM subjects in general and computing in particular have been more difficult to articulate. Moreover, the decolonisation shift has been largely confined to bricks and mortar universities, with little exploration of online and distance learning. This paper reports on an initiative in a British distance learning university to decolonise the computing curriculum, with a focus on students’ perspectives and what barriers might be encountered. A survey of just under 400 undergraduate computing students revealed multiple understandings about decolonisation, and reactions ranging from hostility and resistance to strong support and endorsement. Students identified several challenges to student engagement including structural and practical concerns which should inform the computing education community in taking forward this agenda.

Research Impact and Sustainability in Education: A Conceptual Literature Review,"Research sustainability and research impact are closely related concepts, both referring to the importance of extending research projects’ outcomes, changes or benefits beyond their period of implementation. However, the prominence assigned to these two concepts has been provided in an individualized way. This study aims to understand how research sustainability and impact are portrayed and problematized in the literature, in the field of Education, and how they (inter)connect, identifying reference authors and frameworks and describing factors that influence research sustainability and its impact in Education. A conceptual literature review was conducted, and 31 articles were analyzed under the scope of an interpretative paradigm according to the content analysis methodology, using webQDA 3.0 software as support. First, categories were established to identify reference authors and frameworks. Afterward, an inductive codification was carried out, and 15 categories emerged to research sustainability and its impact on Education. This analysis highlights the interconnectedness of both concepts at the conceptualization level and the factors that influence them. The results allow us to identify and discuss action axes, that need more attention in order to assure research sustainability and to evidence research impact in the field of Education.

Development and Evaluation of a Custom GPT for the Assessment of Students’ Designs in a Typography Course,"The recent advancements in the fields of AI technology, generative AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased the potential of the deployment of such tools in educational environments, especially in contexts where student assessment fairness, quality, and automation are a priority. This study introduces an AI-enhanced evaluation tool that utilizes OpenAI’s GPT-4 and the recently released custom GPT feature to evaluate the typography designs of 25 students enrolled in the Visual Media diploma offered by King Abdulaziz University. A mixed methods approach is adopted to evaluate the performance of this tool against the rubric-based evaluations offered by two human evaluators, considering both grading and text feedback. The results indicate that there are statistically significant differences between the AI tool’s grading and feedback when compared to that of Evaluator 2; however, none is reported with Evaluator 1. The study presents a qualitative interpretation of the comprehensive feedback by the evaluator and reflects in further research in this area.

University–Museum Partnerships for K-12 Engineering Learning: Understanding the Utility of a Community Co-Created Informal Education Program in a Time of Social Disruption,"This study explores the impact of COVID-19 on informal learning institutions, primarily science museums, through the lens of an activity kit co-created by CELL-MET—a cross-university, engineering research center—and museum partners. While formal learning organizations, like K-12 schools, play a critical role in the education process through standardized teaching, informal learning organizations also make important contributions to the engineering education ecosystem, such as by fostering engineering identity development, especially for learners and their families. This is particularly valuable for young learners from underrepresented and under-resourced communities. In this study, two questions are addressed: (1) How were museums impacted by COVID-19 and the resulting disruptions to their operations, and how did they respond? (2) To what extent were museums able to implement and adapt EEK! to reach under-served youth in the face of social disruption? When the world was experiencing social disruption from the spread of COVID-19, the authors realized they had an opportunity to test the utility and adaptability of their model of engineering activity co-creation. Approximately six months into the launch of both EEK! and the global pandemic, a 29-item survey was distributed to EEK! recipient institutions. Of the museum respondents, 97% reported experiencing full closures and 73% reported layoffs and furloughs. Despite these challenges, 78% implemented EEK!, with 70% of the institutions creating new virtual programming, and 38% adapting EEK! for remote facilitation, including real-time virtual events, self-guided activities, and at-home activity kits. Museums were equally impacted by COVID-19 policies and closures, but have not received the public attention and support that K-12 schools have received. Nonetheless, they have responded with ingenuity in using and adapting EEK!. Given their K-12 partnerships, flexibility, and ability to engage learners, museums are undervalued collaborators for universities trying to impact the K-12 engineering education ecosystem.

Of Microscopes and Meeting Places: A Literature Review Examining Barriers to Indigenous Participation in STEM,"STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) was once not seen as a place for everyone. In fact, a powerful majority of people believed that individuals had to have predetermined characteristics that made them able to bear such vast and liberating knowledge. Centuries later, concentrated efforts are still needed to reverse the damage that the prevalence of such an ideology caused. When one considers the exclusion of individuals from a particular field, they may only see one side of the story; they may think that the only factor stopping the out-group from participating is the in-group trying to keep them out. The bigger picture tells the story of the consequences of enduring exclusion of the out-group, even well after explicit exclusionary tactics cease to exist. The awareness and study of this phenomenon in regard to several groups of historically excluded people have expanded in the modern era, helping to reduce its lasting effects. Some groups continue to participate in STEM at a much lower rate than their peers. Native Americans are a particularly interesting example of this. This review will explore some of the various reasons posed for the way and rate at which Native Americans are involved in STEM education and will attempt to determine the prevalence of each explanation and their interactions with each other.

Assessment of the Perceived Mastery of Interdisciplinary Competences of Students in Education Degree Programmes,"The importance of fostering interdisciplinary competences in students acquires a relevant value in the skills that must be developed throughout university studies. These enable them to tackle complex problems and apply knowledge in different contexts, promoting the construction of knowledge through the integration of different disciplines and collaboration between areas of knowledge. The study aims to analyse how university education students perceive their interdisciplinary competences, identifying areas where they feel more confident and those in which they need to improve, with consideration of gender differences and a possible measurement model. The study involves 1066 students from university education courses in Ecuador. The main results highlight the importance of strengthening training in interdisciplinary skills for future teachers, especially in reflective behaviour and the integration of knowledge from different disciplines to address complex problems. It also points to the need to promote interdisciplinary work in higher education and recognises that gender may influence students’ interdisciplinary perceptions and skills. Confirmatory factor analysis supports the validity of the model for measuring these competences.

Novice Teachers and Mentor Teachers: From a Traditional Model to a Holistic Mentoring Model in the Postmodern Era,"Mentors support novice teachers in the critical stages of their learning, which has an effect on novice teachers’ ability to engage in teaching and to stay in the teaching profession for years. The mentor teacher also helps the novice teacher become well integrated and develop professionally. The current study aims to examine the factors that motivate mentor teachers to occupy this position, the guidance and support components of the role and their implementation in the mentoring process, and the frequency and planning of the encounters between mentor and novice teachers, in the context of the Israeli education system. Also examined are the attitudes of mentor teachers towards their role and their perceived ability to operate efficiently. The research population comprises 46 research participants who mentor novice teachers in high schools in Israel. Analysis of their attitudes shows that the factors that motivated them to serve as mentor teachers are related to a consciousness guided by a sense of personal mission and intrinsic motivation to promote novice teachers. Also, factors related to realizing their personal values and aims, such as realizing a vision, personal satisfaction, interest, and challenge, were found to be common. According to self-reported findings, mentor teachers were very helpful to novice teachers on issues such as class management, managing and planning teaching, evaluating students, and nurturing a professional identity. They also supported emotional aspects related to the teaching process, including their sense of efficacy and contact with the students. Mentor teachers felt a great deal of satisfaction with the mentoring process and would recommend this experience to other teachers to a high degree. Hence, a teacher who chooses the profession from a sense of a personal mission in the education system will also see their mentoring role as a mission for the sake of the next generation. Leaders in the education system are advised to develop a more holistic mentoring model that incorporates the traditional mentoring model yet guides us towards a mentoring process that is better adapted to the postmodern era, and is based on a long-term strategy for helping retain novice teachers within the education system.

A Mixed Study of Beliefs about Critical Thinking in a Sample of Trainee Teachers in Argentina and Spain,"Critical thinking is a competence that is recommended to be learned with increasing emphasis from different national and international organizations in the fields of education and employability. The aim of this study was to analyze and describe the beliefs that Argentine and Spanish teachers who have received training in socioeducational intervention have about critical competence. A mixed-methods research study was developed by administering questionnaires and conducting focus group sessions in a sample of 153 trainee secondary school teachers holding different degrees. The results indicated that the sample subjects unanimously considered critical thinking to be essential for their professional development, but few teachers considered these skills to have been sufficiently developed. There were no significant differences between nationalities or between genders except for some variables linked to the role of universities. As a practical implication of these results, the importance of developing specific teaching–learning programs about critical competence in universities must be emphasized, especially in the degree programs whose ultimate aim is to educate individuals and groups.

Academic Third Mission through Community Engagement: An Empirical Study in European Universities,"Community engagement is fundamental for tertiary education, as it allows universities to connect with external stakeholders, create social impact, and improve the development of strategies for public engagement. The current study aims to evaluate the level of community engagement in tertiary education, assess the level of sustainable practices, and identify areas for improvement. The research employed a survey method, using a standardized questionnaire to gather data from 44 respondents, representing 35 European universities from nine countries. The survey covered various aspects of community engagement, such as university commitment, documentation, public awareness, investments, incentives, training, and stakeholder engagement. Quantitative analysis was employed using ANOVA and AHP to analyze the data collected from 20 questions. The results revealed that universities have a clear commitment to public engagement and have well-documented policies in place. However, there were areas identified for improvement, such as increasing investments to encourage public engagement and offering more training activities to support it. Additionally, the universities were found to have a limited target group for their community engagement activities and insufficient communication of the results of impact assessments. The findings of this study will be used to improve the development of strategies and enhance public engagement in tertiary education through the Academic Third Mission.

Teachers’ Continuing Professional Development: Action Research for Inclusion and Special Educational Needs and Disability,"In 2022, the authors of this paper were awarded with three years’ government funding to support seventy-five English schools and Further Education colleges with the running of their own Action Research for inclusion and special educational needs projects (ISEND). Based on the funder’s interest in the identification and scaling-up of the evidence-base for SEND practice, this reflective account analyzes the evidence-base drawn upon and created by the Action Researchers for ISEND and the efficacy of the approach. Adopting an interpretivist, qualitative approach to content analysis, this paper analyzes data from the first seven completed Action Research for ISEND projects. Aligned with Dewey’s scientific model of reflection, analysis shows the Action Researchers for ISEND draw upon a complex synthesis of contextualized understanding, broadened horizons (including collaborative working and study), deepened and/or reshaped understandings, and data analysis to form their theorizations of praxis. Bearing no relation to evidence-based practice, the Action Researchers for ISEND adopt a constructivist ontology towards the inclusion of children with SEND, which challenges positivistic paradigms of “what works” in SEND and embeds a praxis of democracy which frequently includes the voices of learners with disabilities in decision making processes.

A Hands-On Collaboration-Ready Single- or Interdisciplinary Computational Exercise in Molecular Recognition and Drug Design,"Molecular docking plays an increasingly necessary role in interdisciplinary research, particularly in modern drug design. Pharmaceutical companies compose a trillion dollar per year industry and the public is generally unaware of how beneficial pharmaceutics come to be. Despite this increasing relevance in contemporary research, docking and, by extension, computational science, have been under-represented in undergraduate education in the chemical, biochemical, and biophysical sciences. We describe herein how a multidisciplinary approach is used to design novel inhibitors of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme (BChE), an upregulated protein in patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. Students will then be able to compare their designed inhibitors to known BChE inhibitors via molecular docking using this easily adapted hands-on computational laboratory exercise or at-home activity that provides users with a module in which to learn the fundamentals of computer-aided drug design. While being well suited for upper-division courses in biology/biochemistry and physics/physical chemistry, the accessibility of this module allows for its incorporation into college curricula as early as second-term organic chemistry. Highly portable freeware makes this an ideal learning tool by which to infuse single- or multidisciplinary drug design reasoning into college level curricula at no cost to the student or instructor.

"Investigating the Impacts of Shame-Proneness on Students’ State Shame, Self-Regulation, and Learning","We explored relationships between students’ shame-proneness and their experiences of state shame, self-regulation, and learning in a laboratory. We conducted two studies with different content: physics (Study 1, n = 179) and the circulatory system (Study 2, n = 85). We first evaluated students’ shame-proneness, self-regulation, and content knowledge (pretest). Then, half of the students participated in the experimental condition where state shame was induced. Subsequently, we evaluated students’ state shame and learning gains. In both studies, t-tests demonstrated that the experimental manipulation effectively induced higher levels of state shame. Follow-up 2 (experimental/control condition) by 2 (high/low shame-proneness) ANOVAs revealed that, in the experimental shame-induced condition, participants who had high shame-proneness had significantly higher state shame levels than those with low shame-proneness. Regarding students’ self-regulation, in both studies, high-shame-prone students had lower self-regulation skills. Interestingly, the outcomes of students’ learning gains differed in Studies 1 and 2. The results of a 2 (condition) by 2 (shame-proneness) ANOVA for Study 1 indicated no significant differences in students’ learning gains. In Study 2, participants in the experimental condition who reported high shame-proneness had significantly lower learning gains than those with low shame-proneness. We discuss several educational implications and provide directions for future research.

A Multidimensional Analysis of a High-Stakes English Listening Test: A Corpus-Based Approach,"The Gaokao, also known as China’s national college entrance exam, is a high-stakes exam for nearly all Chinese students. English has been one of the three most important subjects for a long time, and listening plays an important role in the Gaokao English test. However, relatively little research has been conducted on local versions of Gaokao’s English listening tests. This study analyzed the linguistic features and corresponding functional dimensions of the three different text types in the Gaokao’s listening test, investigating whether the papers used in three major regions of China were differentiated in terms of the co-occurrence patterns of lexicogrammatical features and dimensions of the transcripts. A corpus consisting of 170 sets of test papers (134,913 words) covering 31 provinces and cities from 2000 to 2022 was analyzed using a multidimensional analysis wherein six exclusive dimensions were extracted. The results showed that there were meaningful differences across short conversations, long conversations, and monologues with regard to the six dimensions’ scores, and regions further had significant differences in three dimensions: Syntactic and Clausal Complexity, Oral versus Literate Discourse, and Procedural Discourse, while Time Period was not associated with any differences. Implications for language teaching and assessment are discussed.

Assessing Disparities in Predictive Modeling Outcomes for College Student Success: The Impact of Imputation Techniques on Model Performance and Fairness,"The education sector has been quick to recognize the power of predictive analytics to enhance student success rates. However, there are challenges to widespread adoption, including the lack of accessibility and the potential perpetuation of inequalities. These challenges present in different stages of modeling, including data preparation, model development, and evaluation. These steps can introduce additional bias to the system if not appropriately performed. Substantial incompleteness in responses is a common problem in nationally representative education data at a large scale. This can lead to missing data and can potentially impact the representativeness and accuracy of the results. While many education-related studies address the challenges of missing data, little is known about the impact of handling missing values on the fairness of predictive outcomes in practice. In this paper, we aim to assess the disparities in predictive modeling outcomes for college student success and investigate the impact of imputation techniques on model performance and fairness using various notions. We conduct a prospective evaluation to provide a less biased estimation of future performance and fairness than an evaluation of historical data. Our comprehensive analysis of a real large-scale education dataset reveals key insights on modeling disparities and the impact of imputation techniques on the fairness of the predictive outcome under different testing scenarios. Our results indicate that imputation introduces bias if the testing set follows the historical distribution. However, if the injustice in society is addressed and, consequently, the upcoming batch of observations is equalized, the model would be less biased.

Improving Black Entrepreneurship through Cannabis-Related Education,"Economic inequality is a significant and growing issue in the U.S., particularly within Black communities. Improving Black entrepreneurship is critical to addressing the economic gaps. In this paper, we discuss a unique, newly established educational program focused on cannabis education at Medgar Evers College (MEC) in New York. One of the goals of the new program is to increase Black entrepreneurship in the rapidly growing cannabis industry. For decades, cannabis use and distribution were criminal offenses that led to the disproportionate incarceration of Black individuals compared to White individuals. As it is being decriminalized across the country, and medical and recreational use spreads, the tool formerly used for Black incarceration can now become a tool for advancing Black entrepreneurship. To work and/or operate a venture in the cannabis industry requires students to understand a range of issues and build a strong foundation of broad knowledge. We discuss the emerging curricula and illustrate some of the elements that will help spur successful new venture creation led by Black and minority entrepreneurs in this exciting new field. Some early successes and lessons learned are discussed, which can help other educational institutions looking to create or improve their own cannabis-related curricula.

Research–Practice Partnership in a Professional Development Program: Promoting Youth at Risk,"Research–Practice Partnerships (RPPs) embody enduring collaborations between practitioners and researchers that systematically address practical challenges to enhance education. This study describes research conducted within the framework of an RPP in which researchers were united with an educational association tasked with leading a professional development program (PDP) for teachers serving youth at risk. This study focuses on demonstrating a model for evaluating the implementation of the program’s educational philosophy among PDP participants. This comprehensive model comprises three interlinked components: cultivating awareness of the educational philosophy, fostering a profound comprehension of its principles, and facilitating the application of practices aligned with this philosophy. To investigate these dimensions, we drew upon data gathered through a survey administered to 140 educators and through in-depth interviews with 22 members of the educational staff. By examining these three pivotal components, we not only dissect the implementation process but also identify strengths and weaknesses, paving the way for a tailored intervention strategy. Beyond the immediate implications for program improvement, this research underscores the program’s reciprocal benefits for both researchers and practitioners. It holds the potential to influence the professional development of those involved, concurrently enriching the broader research community with invaluable insights gained from real-world educational contexts.

Leaders in the education system are advised to develop a more holistic mentoring model that incorporates the traditional mentoring model yet guides us towards a mentoring process that is better adapted to the postmodern era, and is based on a long-term strategy for helping retain novice teachers within the education system.

A Mixed Study of Beliefs about Critical Thinking in a Sample of Trainee Teachers in Argentina and Spain,"Critical thinking is a competence that is recommended to be learned with increasing emphasis from different national and international organizations in the fields of education and employability. The aim of this study was to analyze and describe the beliefs that Argentine and Spanish teachers who have received training in socioeducational intervention have about critical competence. A mixed-methods research study was developed by administering questionnaires and conducting focus group sessions in a sample of 153 trainee secondary school teachers holding different degrees. The results indicated that the sample subjects unanimously considered critical thinking to be essential for their professional development, but few teachers considered these skills to have been sufficiently developed. There were no significant differences between nationalities or between genders except for some variables linked to the role of universities. As a practical implication of these results, the importance of developing specific teaching–learning programs about critical competence in universities must be emphasized, especially in the degree programs whose ultimate aim is to educate individuals and groups.

Academic Third Mission through Community Engagement: An Empirical Study in European Universities,"Community engagement is fundamental for tertiary education, as it allows universities to connect with external stakeholders, create social impact, and improve the development of strategies for public engagement. The current study aims to evaluate the level of community engagement in tertiary education, assess the level of sustainable practices, and identify areas for improvement. The research employed a survey method, using a standardized questionnaire to gather data from 44 respondents, representing 35 European universities from nine countries. The survey covered various aspects of community engagement, such as university commitment, documentation, public awareness, investments, incentives, training, and stakeholder engagement. Quantitative analysis was employed using ANOVA and AHP to analyze the data collected from 20 questions. The results revealed that universities have a clear commitment to public engagement and have well-documented policies in place. However, there were areas identified for improvement, such as increasing investments to encourage public engagement and offering more training activities to support it. Additionally, the universities were found to have a limited target group for their community engagement activities and insufficient communication of the results of impact assessments. The findings of this study will be used to improve the development of strategies and enhance public engagement in tertiary education through the Academic Third Mission.

Teachers’ Continuing Professional Development: Action Research for Inclusion and Special Educational Needs and Disability,"In 2022, the authors of this paper were awarded with three years’ government funding to support seventy-five English schools and Further Education colleges with the running of their own Action Research for inclusion and special educational needs projects (ISEND). Based on the funder’s interest in the identification and scaling-up of the evidence-base for SEND practice, this reflective account analyzes the evidence-base drawn upon and created by the Action Researchers for ISEND and the efficacy of the approach. Adopting an interpretivist, qualitative approach to content analysis, this paper analyzes data from the first seven completed Action Research for ISEND projects. Aligned with Dewey’s scientific model of reflection, analysis shows the Action Researchers for ISEND draw upon a complex synthesis of contextualized understanding, broadened horizons (including collaborative working and study), deepened and/or reshaped understandings, and data analysis to form their theorizations of praxis. Bearing no relation to evidence-based practice, the Action Researchers for ISEND adopt a constructivist ontology towards the inclusion of children with SEND, which challenges positivistic paradigms of “what works” in SEND and embeds a praxis of democracy which frequently includes the voices of learners with disabilities in decision making processes.

A Hands-On Collaboration-Ready Single- or Interdisciplinary Computational Exercise in Molecular Recognition and Drug Design,"Molecular docking plays an increasingly necessary role in interdisciplinary research, particularly in modern drug design. Pharmaceutical companies compose a trillion dollar per year industry and the public is generally unaware of how beneficial pharmaceutics come to be. Despite this increasing relevance in contemporary research, docking and, by extension, computational science, have been under-represented in undergraduate education in the chemical, biochemical, and biophysical sciences. We describe herein how a multidisciplinary approach is used to design novel inhibitors of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme (BChE), an upregulated protein in patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. Students will then be able to compare their designed inhibitors to known BChE inhibitors via molecular docking using this easily adapted hands-on computational laboratory exercise or at-home activity that provides users with a module in which to learn the fundamentals of computer-aided drug design. While being well suited for upper-division courses in biology/biochemistry and physics/physical chemistry, the accessibility of this module allows for its incorporation into college curricula as early as second-term organic chemistry. Highly portable freeware makes this an ideal learning tool by which to infuse single- or multidisciplinary drug design reasoning into college level curricula at no cost to the student or instructor.

"Investigating the Impacts of Shame-Proneness on Students’ State Shame, Self-Regulation, and Learning","We explored relationships between students’ shame-proneness and their experiences of state shame, self-regulation, and learning in a laboratory. We conducted two studies with different content: physics (Study 1, n = 179) and the circulatory system (Study 2, n = 85). We first evaluated students’ shame-proneness, self-regulation, and content knowledge (pretest). Then, half of the students participated in the experimental condition where state shame was induced. Subsequently, we evaluated students’ state shame and learning gains. In both studies, t-tests demonstrated that the experimental manipulation effectively induced higher levels of state shame. Follow-up 2 (experimental/control condition) by 2 (high/low shame-proneness) ANOVAs revealed that, in the experimental shame-induced condition, participants who had high shame-proneness had significantly higher state shame levels than those with low shame-proneness. Regarding students’ self-regulation, in both studies, high-shame-prone students had lower self-regulation skills. Interestingly, the outcomes of students’ learning gains differed in Studies 1 and 2. The results of a 2 (condition) by 2 (shame-proneness) ANOVA for Study 1 indicated no significant differences in students’ learning gains. In Study 2, participants in the experimental condition who reported high shame-proneness had significantly lower learning gains than those with low shame-proneness. We discuss several educational implications and provide directions for future research.

A Multidimensional Analysis of a High-Stakes English Listening Test: A Corpus-Based Approach,"The Gaokao, also known as China’s national college entrance exam, is a high-stakes exam for nearly all Chinese students. English has been one of the three most important subjects for a long time, and listening plays an important role in the Gaokao English test. However, relatively little research has been conducted on local versions of Gaokao’s English listening tests. This study analyzed the linguistic features and corresponding functional dimensions of the three different text types in the Gaokao’s listening test, investigating whether the papers used in three major regions of China were differentiated in terms of the co-occurrence patterns of lexicogrammatical features and dimensions of the transcripts. A corpus consisting of 170 sets of test papers (134,913 words) covering 31 provinces and cities from 2000 to 2022 was analyzed using a multidimensional analysis wherein six exclusive dimensions were extracted. The results showed that there were meaningful differences across short conversations, long conversations, and monologues with regard to the six dimensions’ scores, and regions further had significant differences in three dimensions: Syntactic and Clausal Complexity, Oral versus Literate Discourse, and Procedural Discourse, while Time Period was not associated with any differences. Implications for language teaching and assessment are discussed.

Assessing Disparities in Predictive Modeling Outcomes for College Student Success: The Impact of Imputation Techniques on Model Performance and Fairness,"The education sector has been quick to recognize the power of predictive analytics to enhance student success rates. However, there are challenges to widespread adoption, including the lack of accessibility and the potential perpetuation of inequalities. These challenges present in different stages of modeling, including data preparation, model development, and evaluation. These steps can introduce additional bias to the system if not appropriately performed. Substantial incompleteness in responses is a common problem in nationally representative education data at a large scale. This can lead to missing data and can potentially impact the representativeness and accuracy of the results. While many education-related studies address the challenges of missing data, little is known about the impact of handling missing values on the fairness of predictive outcomes in practice. In this paper, we aim to assess the disparities in predictive modeling outcomes for college student success and investigate the impact of imputation techniques on model performance and fairness using various notions. We conduct a prospective evaluation to provide a less biased estimation of future performance and fairness than an evaluation of historical data. Our comprehensive analysis of a real large-scale education dataset reveals key insights on modeling disparities and the impact of imputation techniques on the fairness of the predictive outcome under different testing scenarios. Our results indicate that imputation introduces bias if the testing set follows the historical distribution. However, if the injustice in society is addressed and, consequently, the upcoming batch of observations is equalized, the model would be less biased.

Improving Black Entrepreneurship through Cannabis-Related Education,"Economic inequality is a significant and growing issue in the U.S., particularly within Black communities. Improving Black entrepreneurship is critical to addressing the economic gaps. In this paper, we discuss a unique, newly established educational program focused on cannabis education at Medgar Evers College (MEC) in New York. One of the goals of the new program is to increase Black entrepreneurship in the rapidly growing cannabis industry. For decades, cannabis use and distribution were criminal offenses that led to the disproportionate incarceration of Black individuals compared to White individuals. As it is being decriminalized across the country, and medical and recreational use spreads, the tool formerly used for Black incarceration can now become a tool for advancing Black entrepreneurship. To work and/or operate a venture in the cannabis industry requires students to understand a range of issues and build a strong foundation of broad knowledge. We discuss the emerging curricula and illustrate some of the elements that will help spur successful new venture creation led by Black and minority entrepreneurs in this exciting new field. Some early successes and lessons learned are discussed, which can help other educational institutions looking to create or improve their own cannabis-related curricula.

Computational Thinking (CT) towards Creative Action: Developing a Project-Based Instructional Taxonomy (PBIT) in AI Education,"This paper aims to develop a new model of Project-Based Instructional Taxonomy (PBIT) that provides a tool of course design that facilitates Computational Thinking (CT) development as creative action in solving real-life problems. Theoretically, PBIT is built on an integrative framework bringing together with studies on CT education, creativity, Bloom’s Taxonomy, and Project-Based Instruction (PBI). This guides the course design to make alignment between diverse elements including education objectives, categories of CT, levels of learning ability, process of project facilitation, and methods of grading. A case will be discussed that focuses on a course Deep Learning and Technologies in AI bachelor program at Northeastern University (NEU) in China. It also shows how PBIT is applied in teaching practice that benefits students’ CT development. As the conclusion indicates, this paper has contributions to future research on creativity, PBI, CT, and AI education.

"ZOOMED IN, ZONED OUT: Academic Self-Reports on the Challenges and Benefits of Online Teaching in Higher Education","Online teaching in higher education has become increasingly prevalent, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. While teaching online offers many benefits, it also presents several challenges. Sharing one’s lived experiences as an educator is essential to improving one’s teaching skills and enhancing the learning outcomes for the students. Here, we present our personal and lived experiences as higher education teachers in the VU Block Model® First Year College at Victoria University. In our allied health science subjects, we have identified the key challenges in online teaching, such as technology and infrastructure, student engagement and interaction, adapting learning styles, assessment integrity, digital literacy, social-isolation-related mental health, and workload. The benefits included flexibility, innovative teaching tools, personalised learning and accessibility, and the continuity of teaching and learning despite the pandemic disruption. Overcoming these challenges requires careful planning, effective pedagogy, and ongoing support for both teachers and students. The benefits of online teaching can be maximised when its limitations are acknowledged and addressed appropriately via sharing teacher’s personal narratives as an effective mode of communication.

Research–Practice Partnership in a Professional Development Program: Promoting Youth at Risk,"Research–Practice Partnerships (RPPs) embody enduring collaborations between practitioners and researchers that systematically address practical challenges to enhance education. This study describes research conducted within the framework of an RPP in which researchers were united with an educational association tasked with leading a professional development program (PDP) for teachers serving youth at risk. This study focuses on demonstrating a model for evaluating the implementation of the program’s educational philosophy among PDP participants. This comprehensive model comprises three interlinked components: cultivating awareness of the educational philosophy, fostering a profound comprehension of its principles, and facilitating the application of practices aligned with this philosophy. To investigate these dimensions, we drew upon data gathered through a survey administered to 140 educators and through in-depth interviews with 22 members of the educational staff. By examining these three pivotal components, we not only dissect the implementation process but also identify strengths and weaknesses, paving the way for a tailored intervention strategy. Beyond the immediate implications for program improvement, this research underscores the program’s reciprocal benefits for both researchers and practitioners. It holds the potential to influence the professional development of those involved, concurrently enriching the broader research community with invaluable insights gained from real-world educational contexts.

Course Crafting in the Pandemic: Examination of Students’ Positive Experiences,"College students’ positive experiences were examined before and during COVID-19 when courses transitioned to a new format. During COVID-19, university courses at a state university in the US transitioned to a new online format. This study observed the affective experiences of students through the instructors’ course crafting during times of crisis. The method of critical incident qualitative data collection examined what students perceived as positive experiences. Students’ perceptions were examined, and the nature and types of positive experiences were examined before and during the pandemic. This comparison provided insights into the emotions and feelings experienced between the two groups (Before COVID-19 and During COVID-19). As courses were modified and redesigned for remote learning, examination of the findings showed students’ positive experiences considering the faculty recrafting their courses, which gave a valuable insight into the dynamics of these positive experiences in the teaching and learning process. Educators crafted their courses’ changing format and provided emotional support, empathy, kindness, reassurance, and encouragement when needed. The implications of these findings and understanding how we can thrive and flourish even in very challenging times in the virtual environment is discussed.

The Pernicious Predictability of State-Mandated Tests of Academic Achievement in the United States,"The purpose of this study was to determine the predictiveness of community and family demographic variables related to the development of student academic background knowledge on the percentage of students who pass a state-mandated, commercially prepared, standardized Algebra 1 test in the state of New Jersey, USA. This explanatory, cross-sectional study utilized quantitative methods through hierarchical regression analysis. The results suggest that family demographic variables found in the United States Census data related to the development of student academic background knowledge predicted 75 percent of schools in which students achieved a passing score on a state standardized high school assessment of Algebra 1. We can conclude that construct-irrelevant variance, influenced in part by student background knowledge, can be used to predict standardized test results. The results call into question the use of standardized tests as tools for policy makers and educational leaders to accurately judge student learning or school quality.

Biology and Geology Teachers and Ecoethics Education: From the Guidelines and Training Offered to the Training Needs Felt by Teachers,"Ecoethics studies the moral relationship among human beings, the environment and its non-human components, whereas education for ecoethics involves a reflexion on how to live, how to make environmental choices and how to think about the consequences of human activities. To promote this reflexion, teachers must be able to teach subjects related to ecoethics, having adequate teacher training in the field. Thus, it was considered pertinent to investigate if and how ecoethics appears in the guiding documents for teachers' practices and in initial and continuing training courses for Portuguese biology and geology teachers, as well as whether these teachers feel they need training in ecoethics. To achieve this, document analysis was carried out, and a questionnaire with both close- and open-ended questions was applied at a national level. The main results show that little emphasis is given to ecoethics both in the guiding documents and in initial and continuing training courses for Portuguese BG teachers; most teachers say that they have not dealt with ecoethics issues in their initial and ongoing teacher training but consider them essential. Given the teachers’ influence on students, a focus on teacher training in ecoethics is essential so that they can contribute to solving environmental problems.

Digital and Information Literacy in Basic-Education Teachers: A Systematic Literature Review,"Digital transformation has become constant and has forced governments to reevaluate the validity of their educational models; therefore, regarding digital and information literacy, to train teachers to improve new digital skills becomes essential. For these reasons, this research will explore the instruction of teachers in digital and information literacy in basic education; likewise, there will be an observation of the research’s theoretical-methodological characteristics related to these variables, and, also, we will carry out an analysis of the most pertinent contributions on the impact of new literacies and competencies in the teaching–learning processes in basic education, with the purpose of obtaining a current state overview of its teacher training within the framework of the technologies’ usage linked to teaching. This review was based on the guidelines of the PRISMA protocol, and to select 56 documents, the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases were used. The results show that, in the Scopus database, Spain is the country with the most research on the subject, with 29% of the total, followed by Indonesia, with 6%, and the United States, with 4%, and that the articles focus mainly on the social sciences and computer science. Likewise, in WoS, the country with the most research on the subject is Spain, with 30%, followed by Russia, with 10%, and Norway, with 8%, and the articles mainly revolve around the categories of education and communication. The research related to this topic uses a quantitative approach in 68%, a qualitative approach in 25% and a mixed approach in 7%. It was shown that there is a direct relationship between digital and information literacy and digital competency. In addition, it is also emphasized that digital and information literacy are continuous and long-term processes. More didactic proposals on digital skills would be necessary, over government policies and efforts, to achieve a community with a high level of digital and information literacy.

An Analysis of the Development of Preschoolers’ Natural Science Concepts from the Perspective of Framework Theory,"The aim of the study was to explore children’s learning of natural science, and the authors chose a literature review as the means to achieve this aim. As the research into children’s emerging science is fragmented into many different theoretical perspectives and many kinds of studies are included, research results deriving from the field can be difficult to summarize. To resolve this issue, Vosniadou’s framework theory was used as the tool for data analysis. Results show emergence as a dynamic interaction between intuitive and counter-intuitive concepts leading to synthetic and scientific models in combination with developing epistemological and ontological skills. The accumulation of synthetic concepts seems to be the most common result of early formal educational input. Both intuitive and synthetic models are predecessors for scientific concepts and models, and these models as such are very important for emerging science. The conclusions suggest that diverse science experiences should bring about more synthetic models. This subsequently creates a wider basis for further development. Another important factor of emergence is the development of children’s epistemic skills and ontological shifts. Research results suggest that it is important for teachers to support children’s epistemic and ontological skills. Enhancing children’s understanding about causality and ontology is an important step towards developing formal concepts of science.

Culturally Responsive Pedagogical Knowledge: An Integrative Teacher Knowledge Base for Diversified STEM Classrooms,"Teaching can be challenging, especially when teachers are under-prepared to enter a workforce with a constantly changing landscape. Preparing teachers for STEM content has generated multiple approaches from varying perspectives. While some scholars advocate for content expertise, others promote pedagogy or social context as approaches for translating STEM content for students. Yet, many contend that teachers must be culturally knowledgeable to respond to student diversity effectively. While these arguments are valuable and needed, many have not considered the interconnectedness of these approaches, often used in silos. This conceptual paper unpacks some of these arguments using the social constructivism theory of learning as the epistemic lens to examine and interpret what STEM teacher knowledge should encompass in the 21st-century diversified classroom. After thoroughly evaluating the core elements of three commonly used teacher constructs, this paper presents an integrative, holistic teacher knowledge—culturally responsive pedagogical knowledge (CRPK) framework that considers the necessary qualities that teachers must possess that are functional, content-focused, and pedagogically inclusive. The proposed CRPK construct would be a valuable programmatic tool for teacher preparation, curriculum development, and classroom praxis.

Digital Bonds: Exploring the Impact of Computer-Mediated Communication on Parent–Educator Relationships in Early Childhood Education and Care,"Despite advancements in the use of mobile technology in recent years, investigation of the technology designed for communication in parent–educator relationships in early education and its impact remains limited. This study investigated how computer-mediated communication could support parent–educator communication in the early childhood education and care (ECEC) sector. The participants selected were parent users (n = 140) at sites in Ontario, Canada, who had implemented a specified communication application; these participants were recruited by email, as identified within the organization’s database. Using a retrospective mixed-method design involving open- and close-ended and blended questions, an online survey consisting of 47 researcher-created questions was used to assess participants’ perspectives of changes in parent–educator communication. The quantitative and qualitative survey data were analyzed using paired sample sign tests and thematic analysis. Computer-mediated communication was found to have the potential to strengthen parent–educator communication practices, particularly when paired with face-to-face communication. The participants reported increased communication content regarding their children’s daily experiences, which positively influenced both parent–educator and parent–child relationships. To facilitate technology-mediated communication in childcare settings in the future, ongoing training and clear expectations for its use are recommended to support the effective application of technology within parent–educator communication practice.

A Study of the Effects of a Structured Daily Physical Activity Intervention in Schools in Malta,"The measurement of daily step counts is a widely adopted and efficacious approach for assessing children’s physical activity levels. With the aim of finding out the effect of daily PA sessions in schools on the total PA levels in terms of steps taken, two (treatment and control) Year Four classrooms (with students aged from eight to nine years old) in three participating schools in Malta participated in this study. A random sample of 45 children across all the treatment and control groups wore pedometers for five continuous school days. Additional data were logged to facilitate data analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted on data from 18 participants, as incomplete data were eliminated. The findings show that a daily physical activity programme was sufficient to make a significant difference in the number of steps taken at school. It also made the difference between Maltese schools being either under par (if not engaged in daily PA at school) or among high-performing nations (if engaged in daily PA at school) in terms of the proportional contribution of steps taken at school to children’s total PA. However, the capacity for school-based activity to exert wider effects on total steps taken throughout the entire day appears to be limited. Reported engagement in additional formal sports activities outside school also had limited effects on steps overall. Finally, a statistical model incorporating sex, daily PA, sports participation, and BMI as exogenous variables accounted only for around a quarter of the variation in average daily pedometer-measured PA, leaving approximately 75% of the variation unexplained. Implications of the findings are discussed, including recommendations for alternative ways of conceptualising and promoting health-related physical activity and exercise.

Teaching in Higher Education after COVID-19: Optimizing Faculty Time and Effort Using a Proposed Model,"We propose a model for use in higher education after COVID-19 that addresses how to organize class methods for effective and efficient teaching outcomes for both students and instructors. Faculty have a finite amount of time that they may spend on their courses and must determine which time combinations produce the best outcomes. First, we discuss the key work-related challenges faced by faculty and contend that competing demands on faculty time result in inefficient allocation of their time and effort. We then model the issue as an optimization problem and illustrate through examples how to help faculty choose optimal method combinations along with time spent. We use time as a measure of effort and define which combination of methods might be most effective for achieving course learning objectives. There are opportunities for wider use of this methodology, as effective application of effort toward meeting the appropriate learning objectives should create better outcomes. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, including how administrators can use it to support and encourage faculty.

Academic Stress and Anxiety among Portuguese Students: The Role of Perceived Social Support and Self-Management,"Adolescents are experiencing increasing levels of anxiety and academic stress, with schools being privileged contexts to foster mental health literacy and hinder stress and anxiety. Social support and self-management skills have been described as protective factors for these phenomena. Therefore, this cross-sectional study examines the relations between social support, self-management skills, academic stress, and anxiety among adolescents, analyzing the mediational role of self-management in the relation between social support, academic stress, and anxiety. Participants included 137 adolescents, with an average age of 12.56 years (SD = 0.68), who completed the Perception of Academic Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Self-Control and Self-Management Scale, Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale, and a sociodemographic questionnaire. Results showed that students generally perceive moderate levels of social support from parents, teachers, and peers; moderate levels of academic stress and mild anxiety; and have self-management skills. Findings showed that self-management is related to social support, academic stress, and anxiety, with gender influencing academic stress and anxiety. Self-management was found to mediate the link between social support, academic stress, and anxiety. The results underscore the importance of fostering social support and self-management skills to mitigate academic stress and anxiety.

Synchronous Distance Learning: Effects of Interest and Achievement Goals on Police Students’ Learning Engagement and Outcomes,"Online learning has boomed, especially in synchronous settings. Questions remain open regarding the influence of interruptions and learner factors such as interest and achievement goals on learning engagement and outcomes. To address these questions, the present field study relied on a synchronous online course and evaluated it with a sample of 136 police students (Mage = 29.58 years). Not only did the online course foster students’ self-efficacy, it was also given similarly high evaluations to previous offline iterations of the course. Furthermore, the students’ self-perceived learning gains correlated highly with actual test performance. Their interest was a positive predictor of these learning gains, whereas work avoidance goals were a negative predictor of learning gains. Learning engagement mediated these effects. Finally, learning outcomes and interruptions were negatively associated. Our results imply that instructors should consider interest and achievement goals as important learning predictors, as well as the detrimental effects of interruptions on learning outcomes.

Predicting Transfer of Generic Information Literacy Competencies by Non-Traditional Students to Their Study and Work Contexts: A Longitudinal Perspective,"Rapid developments in contemporary societies not only ask for lifelong learning but increasingly also for training in generic competencies suitable for multiple contexts and life stages. An indicator of training success is the transfer or application of new learning, a longitudinal process influenced by various theory- and evidence-based factors. The present study combined a multi-contextual and longitudinal approach by investigating non-traditional distance education students’ intention to transfer newly acquired generic information literacy competencies to their study and work contexts before, directly after, and three months after training. Three surveys, using a combination of Ajzen’s theory of planned behavior and Holton et al.’s Learning Transfer System Inventory model, measured the influence of performance outcomes expectations, organizational openness to change, and performance self-efficacy on intention to transfer and transfer behaviour. The participants were 82 adult educational professionals enrolled in an online information literacy course at the Open University. Partial least squares-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) confirmed the value of employing a multi-contextual and longitudinal approach within this specific setting. Furthermore, notably, self-efficacy appeared to predict pre-training intention in both study and work contexts and transfer behaviour in the work context. Educational implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.

Transitioning to Success: The Link between E-CTE and College Preparation for Students with Learning Disabilities in the United States,"In recent years, there has been a specific call to not only increase the number of engineering-trained individuals but also to address the lack of diversity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, including individuals with disabilities. In particular, students with learning disabilities (SWLDs) make up a large portion of all students and are, therefore, a crucial population on which to focus educational and career progression efforts. One potential means of promoting persistence along the STEM pipeline—engineering specifically—is through engineering career and technical education (E-CTE) coursework in high school. Using a nationally representative dataset, we explore how E-CTE participation links to college preparation and transition activities for SWLDs, including math SAT performance, dual credit course participation, college application, and FAFSA completion. Under our more rigorous school fixed-effects models, we find that E-CTE participation is associated with beneficial results across each of our outcomes. The implications are discussed.

Using Simulations and Screencasts in Online Preclass Activities to Support Student Building of Mental Models,"As online learning and flipped classes become more important in chemistry instruction, the development of learning materials that can be used to support students’ independent learning of conceptual chemistry content is critical. This paper summarizes the key findings from an eight-year investigation of effective practices for using simulations in preclass introductions to core chemistry concepts with a focus on supporting students’ development of particulate-level models. Student learning gains for six core chemistry concepts were compared for students’ independent use of a simulation using scaffolded instructions versus students’ viewing a screencast of instructors modeling the use of the simulation to answer a series of questions. Though both approaches resulted in student learning gains and provided a solid foundation for subsequent instruction, the screencast approach provided additional benefits. These included avoiding potential simulation limitations and the ability to add instructional content to support student learning. Additionally, studying many iterations of assignments for several different topics yielded an assignment design framework that provides guidelines for instructors looking to create or use simulation-based preclass activities in the classroom to support student learning.

Enculturating a Protective Professional Community—Processes of Teacher Retention in a Swedish Hard-to-Staff School,"This study presented a positive deviant case: a Swedish hard-to-staff school which has had a low rate of teacher turnover over time. In line with the purpose of studying positive deviance in organisations, our exploratory inquiry was geared towards understanding how and why ‘at-risk’ teachers, i.e., teachers who teach in subjects which are known to have high levels of staffing difficulties in Sweden, stayed at this particular school. Using a modified grounded theory approach, our results suggested that teachers remained at the school due to being embedded in a protective professional community that was enculturated by different expressions of collegiality. Finally, these findings are discussed in relation to the theoretical concepts of teachers’ job embeddedness and social capital.

Self-Esteem among University Students: How It Can Be Improved through Teamwork Skills,"Teamwork skills have been demonstrated to be excellent allies for the academic and professional sphere, and they can improve students’ psychological balance and self-esteem. For this reason, it is important to explore the relationship between teamwork skills and self-esteem. Considering the relevance of soft skills and self-esteem in university training, the main objective of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between teamwork skills and the successful development of self-esteem, a fundamental emotional factor in education. Additionally, we will analyse how self-esteem is related to other socio-academic factors (age, sex, and GPA). A questionnaire was distributed to social science university students. The Rosenberg 10-item scale, which aims to measure feelings of personal worth and self-respect, has been used to determine self-esteem. To measure soft skills for teamwork, we chose the Teamwork Skills Questionnaire, which evaluates the skill level of an individual in order to participate effectively in teamwork. The regression model indicates that self-esteem predictors related to teamwork skills are decision making, leadership, and communication. The results suggest significant differences in some individual variables, such as sex and age, with lower self-esteem being observed in females and older students. The described enriching interactions suggest the need to integrate teamwork training and self-esteem fostering at university to offer students lifelong competencies for their future success.

The Student Evaluation of Teaching Premium for Clinical Faculty in Economics,"This article uses student evaluation of teaching (SET) data for 947 faculty members affiliated with 90 U.S. colleges and universities to study the presence of a teaching quality rating premium for clinical economics faculty relative to traditional tenure-track economics faculty. Based on OLS estimation, we find this difference ranges between 3.9% and 4.8% and is robust to different econometric model specifications. Moreover, the average treatment effect from a propensity score weighting approach suggests that the difference ranges between 5.8% and 6.1%. Lastly, our analysis produces an institutional ranking of economics departments based on department-level SETs. Overall, our findings are encouraging signs for the hiring and retention of clinical faculty in economics departments.

Understanding Science Teachers’ Integration of Active Methodologies in Club Settings: An Exploratory Study,"This study analyses if school science clubs may serve as a resource to facilitate the introduction of active methodologies into science classrooms. Focusing on science clubs in Portuguese schools, this study aims to determine whether the teachers who coordinate and direct these clubs promote activities that incorporate aspects of problem-based learning and project-based learning methodologies. In order to do so, a series of semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 teachers, and their responses were analysed using content analysis strategies. The results show that although they do not explicitly refer to the use of these methodologies, teachers do propose the implementation of projects within clubs, and they incorporate aspects of these strategies in the activities they conduct. In this sense, teachers appreciate the role of clubs in promoting these types of strategies (PBL y PjBL) and the facilities they offer for their implementation. Additionally, teachers believe that one can only learn how to do projects through practise, i.e., doing projects with their students, and they think that clubs offer an opportunity to develop PBL and PjBL methodologies in a context free from the responsibilities and constraints of the classroom.

Identifying Implementation Strategies for Integrating Drones into STEM and Career Technology Education CTE Programs,"As drone technology is rapidly becoming accessible to school children in terms of both low cost and ease-of-use, primary and secondary school teachers are beginning to consider where modern drones can play an important role in schooling. To date, there is little empirical education research printed in the education research literature guiding innovative curriculum developers in the incipient domain of drone education. As a result, teachers interested in including emerging technologies in their classrooms are often at a loss of where to begin. Through clinical interviews with schoolteachers in the United States, our study identified five readily accessible “departure points” to include drones in contemporary STEM and vocational technology (CTE) school classrooms that help teachers address common curricular goals. Taken together, these interviews reveal that teachers using drones follow one of several distinct pathways as a first step toward achieving a widespread goal of teaching students to use modern technologies to construct, pursue, and communicate findings of fruitful research inquiries—the prevalence of which is not reflected in a comprehensive review of the literature. The five dominant pathways for starting a successful drone education emerging from the interview data were as follows: timed racing trials; precision flight obstacle courses; computer coding; videography; and domain-specific knowledge of drone operation laws and ethics.

Assessing Teachers’ Capabilities to Work with Models and Evaluate Results in the Context of a Complex and Authentic STEM Problem,"Since the practice turn, the contemporary education landscape has been shifting from mere knowledge dissemination to empowering students to solve problems. Special emphasis is given to problems on which students work for an extended period (at least several hours; frequently multiple school days). While working on such problems, it is essential to employ a variety of activities. Two of these are working with models and evaluating models and their results. One topic that has received little attention up to now is the question of to what extent educators are able to apply these skills. This study, fundamentally exploratory in nature, seeks to delve into such an assessment by evaluating the competence of n=20n=20<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline""><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>20</mn></mrow></semantics></math> educators in estimating and evaluating building evacuation duration using digital simulations.

Evaluating the Impact of the WEI4S Instructional Approach on Middle School Students’ Algebraic Problem-Solving Skills,"This study investigates the effectiveness of an instructional approach called “Worked-out Examples Involving 4 Stages” (WEI4S) for enhancing middle school students’ algebraic problem-solving skills and reducing CL. Based on cognitive load theory (CLT), WEI4S combines four stages (analyse, explain, investigate, and apply) to facilitate deep comprehension. This study involved 36 novice seventh-grade students identified as having challenges solving algebraic word problems. Participants were randomly assigned to different groups, including the experimental group that received the WEI4S intervention and a control group that participated in problem-solving activities. Pre- and post-tests, as well as a transfer test, were administered to measure algebra performance and CL, and students’ opinions about the intervention were collected. The findings revealed that students exposed to WEI4S showed significant improvements in algebra performance, decreased intrinsic CL, and no negative changes in terms of extrinsic and germane load compared to the control group. Overall, the WEI4S approach offers a promising avenue for effective mathematics instruction by providing a structured framework that encourages active engagement and problem-solving skills.

Interactive Homework: A Tool for Parent Engagement,"Families have largely been excluded from the implementation of the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSSM), reducing their ability to extend their child’s mathematics learning. CCSSM emphasizes different instructional elements (e.g., pictorial representations, problem solving, multiple strategies for solving) that may differ greatly from how parents learned mathematics. In addition, many school officials have ineffectively engaged parents in the changes, further diminishing their capacity to participate in their child’s learning. This case study examined parent mathematics self-efficacy and parent mathematics knowledge for teaching, factors that influence the effectiveness of their engagement in their child’s mathematics learning. This study was also implemented to identify elements that the parent participant found helpful for their child’s mathematics learning. A thematic analysis was performed on the data sources, the interactive homework assignments, a survey, observations, a researcher’s journal, and an interview to conclude that the interactive homework assignments improved parent mathematics self-efficacy and parent mathematics knowledge for teaching. The parent participant also identified the assignments’ side-by-side examples, additional practice, and the easy access of the assignments as features of the intervention that enhanced her ability to support her child.

Using Wikipedia to Develop 21st Century Skills: Perspectives from General Education Students,"Purpose: The aim of the study was to find out how and why students use Wikipedia and what their attitudes are towards Wikipedia as a source of information for learning. Methodology: The article is based on a quantitative study in which 381 Estonian school children participated in filling out an online survey. The questionnaire included both multiple-choice and open-ended questions. Findings: Statistical analyses and responses to open-ended questions showed that students often use Wikipedia as a primary source of information, but that their use of the site for learning tasks is guided by teachers’ attitudes and perceptions towards Wikipedia. Students perceive Wikipedia as a quick and convenient source of information but are uncertain about its reliability. Under teachers’ guidance, they have learnt to search for information and to be source-critical, while more attention is needed to develop academic literacy, including both text comprehension and text composition. Value: As there is still very little research on how Wikipedia is used for learning purposes in general education schools, the results of the study contribute to further discussion on the potential of Wikipedia as an innovative teaching tool for different subjects.

Photographs of Play: Narratives of Teaching,"Research affirms positive results between children’s play and academic success. While play is heavily featured within the early childhood curriculum, limited studies have explored how play is actually implemented within early years settings. The aim of this study was to enhance children’s play and learning by using photographs to explore play-related pedagogical practices of early childhood teachers in Australia over time. Using visual narrative inquiry, three families participated (mother and child) and shared school photos of the mother in an early childhood context and the current child in an early childhood context. The photos were analysed with a visual analysis approach to understand play and teaching across the two time periods. Key findings revealed what has changed and what has become part of the foundation of play in Australian early childhood education. Findings are important to expand the current understanding of play and the historical perspectives of play.

Parents’ Involvement in Choosing Extracurricular Sports Activities: A Gendered Perspective from Israel,"This study explores the multifaceted motivations behind parental decisions to enroll their children in organized sports, with a focus on how these decisions intersect with gender norms and values. Through qualitative interviews with mothers and fathers in Israel, this research uncovers a complex interplay between societal expectations, personal values, and the gender identities of both parents and children. A thematic analysis of the interviews revealed that despite a societal shift towards more gender-neutral perspectives, traditional gender roles persist, particularly in the attitudes of fathers towards the sports participation of their sons. This research identifies a paradox where girls are encouraged to participate in a broader range of sports, including those traditionally viewed as masculine, while boys face more restrictions, particularly against engaging in sports perceived as feminine. Mothers generally exhibit more flexibility in challenging gender norms, suggesting the potential for gradual change in future generations. This study’s findings contribute to the understanding of how parental guidance shapes children’s sports involvement and the perpetuation or challenging of gender norms within this context. Future research could benefit from a broader, more diverse sample and a mixed-methods approach to enhance generalizability and reduce potential biases.

Student and Instructor Ratings in Geographic Information Systems: A Comparative Analysis,"Geographic information system (GIS) education empowers engineering students to make informed decisions, integrate comprehensive data, and communicate effectively through maps and visualizations. In GIS education, it is common to employ problem-based learning, which can benefit from the advantages of peer assessment methods. Among the benefits of peer assessment are the enhancement of students’ capacity for analysis and synthesis, improvement in organizational and professional communication skills, and the development of critical judgement. However, a consequence of its application is that there may be variation in students’ final grades, with no consensus in the literature on this matter. This paper explores the extent to which the application of peer ratings among students can modify student grades in the field of GIS education. This was achieved by conducting an experiment in which undergraduate engineering students assessed two problem-based learning activities carried out by their peers in two different basic GIS courses. The ratings obtained after the peer assessment were compared with the grades given by the instructors. The results allowed us to debate whether the teaching benefits of this strategy compensate for the differences between the students’ grades and those given by instructors. Although no clear pattern was found in the mean ratings awarded by the two groups of evaluators, the results show that student engagement in peer assessment was high. This experience has demonstrated that the assessments of the two groups complement each other and allow students to gain a better understanding of their ratings and how to improve their skills.

Problem Posing and Problem Solving in Primary School: Opportunities for the Development of Different Literacies,"Problem posing and problem solving, involving significant situations for students, encourage effective learning, mathematical reasoning, communication, and connections in/with mathematics, enhancing the emergence of different literacies. Although problem solving is more frequently present in teaching practices, the ability to formulate them must also be developed, since it requires other skills, such as writing a problem statement, establishing connections between reality and mathematical knowledge, and creating and idealizing problematic situations, among others. Financial Literacy and Consumer Literacy promote contexts related to the student’s daily life and are promising in the development of problem posing. These literacies are also relevant to the development of a healthy, balanced, and responsible relationship with money and to raising awareness of the student regarding the importance of their actions in society, the economy, and the environment. This text presents part of a qualitative, descriptive, and interpretive research, developed by a teacher of children in the third year of a Portuguese primary school, involving problem posing and problem solving in Financial and Consumer Education contexts, with the following research question: How does posing and solving problems, in contexts close to the students’ reality, influence the development of different literacies? The results point out the mobilization of different mathematical concepts, in articulation with other areas of knowledge, and the development of skills and knowledge innate to different literacies, namely Mathematical Literacy, Financial Literacy and Consumer Literacy.

Is It Possible to Apply Inquiry in the First Level of Primary School without Hindering the Acquisition of Scientific Competencies? Perspectives of Pupils and Their Pre-Service Teacher,"The aim of this study is to assess the application of inquiry as a teaching strategy during the practicum of a pre-service teacher and to verify the acquisition of scientific skills by her students. The importance of this study is the application of inquiry as a teaching strategy at lower levels of basic education to contribute to scientific skills and scientific literacy. The sample consisted of 27 pupils in the first level of primary education and one pre-service teacher in a Spanish school. The methodology used was a case study with a participatory experimental design, incorporating guided discovery and teacher questioning focused on plant growth. The results indicate that the pupils improved their understanding and assimilation of content related to plant functions, scientific procedures, and critical thinking. The pre-service teacher demonstrated mastery of the inquiry-based methodology, confirming an adequate level of both pedagogical and scientific competence. Some suggestions are provided to enhance her training. The study concludes by demonstrating that it is possible to implement inquiry at any educational level, despite the potential limitations of the students. It is recommended that pre-service teachers receive comprehensive training to enable them to facilitate the acquisition of scientific competence among their students.

Enhancing Employability Skills of Biology Graduates through an Interdisciplinary Project-Based Service Learning Experience with Engineering and Translation Undergraduate Students,"We describe an interdisciplinary experience based on the application of the Project-Based Service Learning (PBSL) methodology for six learning outcomes directly related to employability skills. The objective was to assess students’ learning outcomes, the level of satisfaction of students and lecturers with the PBSL, and the advantages and disadvantages of the implementation of this learning methodology. Interdisciplinary teamwork of undergraduate science, engineering, and humanities students was required to design real-world projects to develop their transferable skills, through the process of learning by doing. Students perceived that PBSL favored employability skills such as knowledge acquisition, self-directed learning, problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, and teamwork skills. Students and lecturers showed high satisfaction with PBSL and outlined its advantages as an active and experiential learning methodology. In conclusion, the implementation of the collaborative and interdisciplinary PBSL methodology is decidedly recommended to enhance Biology, Engineering, and Translation graduates’ learning satisfaction and their future employability.

Seeing Eye to Eye? Comparing Faculty and Student Perceptions of Biomolecular Visualization Assessments,"While visual literacy has been identified as a foundational skill in life science education, there are many challenges in teaching and assessing biomolecular visualization skills. Among these are the lack of consensus about what constitutes competence and limited understanding of student and instructor perceptions of visual literacy tasks. In this study, we administered a set of biomolecular visualization assessments, developed as part of the BioMolViz project, to both students and instructors at multiple institutions and compared their perceptions of task difficulty. We then analyzed our findings using a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative analysis was used to answer the following research questions: (1) Which assessment items exhibit statistically significant disparities or agreements in perceptions of difficulty between instructors and students? (2) Do these perceptions persist when controlling for race/ethnicity and gender? and (3) How does student perception of difficulty relate to performance? Qualitative analysis of open-ended comments was used to identify predominant themes related to visual problem solving. The results show that perceptions of difficulty significantly differ between students and instructors and that students’ performance is a significant predictor of their perception of difficulty. Overall, this study underscores the need to incorporate deliberate instruction in visualization into undergraduate life science curricula to improve student ability in this area. Accordingly, we offer recommendations to promote visual literacy skills in the classroom.

"Reflections of a First-Year Chemistry Teacher: Intersecting PCK, Responsiveness, and Inquiry Instruction","Many educators agree that science instruction should be dominated by inquiry strategies, while others stress the need for responsive practices to place a focus on student learning and understanding. Some scholars believe the two approaches exist on opposite ends of an instructional spectrum, while others believe they may be aligned and intertwined. Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), the broadly accepted gold standard for science education, seems to include both. Understanding how teachers incorporate inquiry strategies and responsiveness and how the two intersect could lead to a more complete framework for K–12 science instruction and help streamline science teacher education. This qualitative single-case study examined the reflections of a first-year chemistry teacher by exploring how she demonstrated responsiveness to students while maintaining a teaching orientation of inquiry-based instruction. Results indicated that responsiveness depended on a high level of PCK and led to higher or lower levels of inquiry based on the students’ need for teacher support. Additionally, findings showed that the teacher’s stated and demonstrated beliefs about inquiry were disconnected. Finally, a gap between science conceptual understanding and mathematics PCK suggested the need to support more innovative mathematics pedagogical strategies during physical science teacher education.

"Impact of Learning Analytics Guidance on Student Self-Regulated Learning Skills, Performance, and Satisfaction: A Mixed Methods Study","Learning analytics (LA) involves collecting, processing, and visualizing big data to help teachers optimize learning conditions. Despite its contributions, LA has not yet been able to meet teachers’ needs because it does not provide sufficient actionable insights that emphasize more on analytics and less on learning. Our work uses specific analytics for student guidance to evaluate an instructional design that focuses on LA agency between teachers and students. The research goal is to investigate whether the minimal and strong guidance provided by the LA learning approach has the same impact on student outcomes. The research questions are as follows “Does the LA-based minimal and strong guidance learning approach have the same impact on student performance and SRL skills? What are the students’ learning perceptions and satisfaction under LA-based guidance?” A mixed methods study was conducted at a university in which LA-based strong guidance was applied to the experimental group and minimal guidance was given to the control group. When strong guidance was applied, the results indicated increased final grades and SRL skills (metacognitive activities, time management, persistence, and help seeking). Furthermore, student satisfaction was high with LA-based guidance. Future research could adapt our study to nonformal education to provide nuanced insights into student outcomes and teachers’ perceptions.

A Quasi-Experimental Study on the Development of Creative Writing Skills in Primary School Students,"The purpose of this research was to evaluate the impact of using an educational program on the development of creative writing skills in fourth-grade students. Creative writing is an important component of teaching, learning, and assessment at the level of primary education. The objectives of the study aimed to identify the general level of development of creative writing skills and establish any significant differences in the development of specific components of creative writing skills (narrative voice, characterization, mood and atmosphere, language and technical aspects of writing, dialogue, narration, setting, image and plot). A quasi-experimental design with intervention and control groups was used. A total of 146 students from 3 public school institutions in the city of Bacau, Romania, that include elementary grades participated in the study. The research group consisted of 73 students in the intervention group and 73 students in the control group. A paired-samples t test was used to compare the scores for two paired variables. The research results have shown that creative writing skills are developing in young school-age students. Also, it was found that there are significant differences in the students from the experimental group, compared to the students in the control group, at the level of the nine components of creative writing skills.

Design Thinking in Higher Education Case Studies: Disciplinary Contrasts between Cultural Heritage and Language and Technology,"Design thinking is a set of cognitive, strategic, and practical procedures used in innovation. This article argues that this approach varies across disciplines. The contexts for this study are two higher educational frameworks where language and technology have different aims and target unique skill sets and where transdisciplinarity is crucial. In our contrastive case study, we use a four-step model to compare two contexts. QUAN(qual) → QUAL mixed methodology is used which includes a quantitative and a qualitative comparative analysis. Context one takes place in an education faculty and focuses on developing cultural heritage. Context two takes place within a research project on linguistics and telecommunications involving linguistic analysis and bioelectrical measurement. Our findings indicate that there are clear and specific differences between the two domains when approaching design thinking. We observe that engineers seem to have a tangible final product in mind at each step of the process, while in the social sciences, the construct is more humanistic in its approach and works towards multiple tangible goals, including an examination of the existing needs in the community. The novelty of the study is the applied approach it takes in treating transdisciplinarity as a skill that is essential both in research as well as in the teaching–learning process.

Supporting Learning Differences: Effects of Cognitive Training on Cognitive Abilities in a School-Based Sample,"A growing body of research demonstrates the effectiveness of computerized cognitive training (CCT) in building specific abilities (e.g., working memory) among school-age children. As a result, CCT is increasingly cited as a means to enhance and support students’ academic performance and school experience. However, many studies exploring CCT as an intervention have done so outside of the school setting, limiting its potential impact with regard to students who may benefit from it but cannot access such supports. This project examined the efficacy of a CCT program implemented within the academic day for all students attending a private school. The findings showed that two CCT programs resulted in improvements in working memory, cognitive flexibility, and/or processing speed among third graders through sixth graders (N = 95). Furthermore, this project demonstrates a model for the effective integration of CCT into a school day without interrupting the academic curriculum. The present results have important implications for the current ideological shift in education that focuses on how to more broadly address students’ learning differences.

Scouts’ Perspectives on Learning Experiences from a Pedagogical Innovation Scope,"The Portuguese educational system aims at nurturing the holistic development of individuals and societal progress, surpassing the mere transmission of curriculum-based knowledge. While considerable advancements have been made, the need for ongoing innovation and equal educational opportunities remains evident, so that all children can have not only equal access to education, but also equal chances of success. This study investigates the largest Portuguese Scout movement, the CNE, exploring its organisational and pedagogical approaches, potentially applicable in formal education settings. This research surveyed participants aged 18–22, having completed approximately 12 years in the Scout movement. Data collection via focus group followed a semi-structured script, before a thorough content analysis was carried. Findings are organised as follows: Pedagogical organisation in learning cycles; Patrol system; The four stages of the Project Method; Characterization of the Scout Game and other learning process dimensions; Other competencies and values developed throughout the Scout learning course; and Comparisons with formal education contexts. The discourse of participants strongly suggests the Scout movement’s potential to inspire educational change, displaying consistent indicators of pedagogical innovation. The study advocates for further exploration of the CNE’s pedagogical functioning and its potential to serve as an inspiration for transformative changes in educational systems worldwide, as evidenced by the learners’ reflections.

A Primer for Design and Systems Thinkers: A First-Year Engineering Course for Mindset Development,"Teaching students to think in complex systems and design is presumably intricate, creative, and nonlinear. However, due to the overwhelming number of standardized tools and frameworks, the process sometimes ends up being procedural and deductive. Conformity to rigid procedures loses the intention of creative problem-solving towards tackling wicked problems. This paper proposes a project-based approach to instill the mindsets for those who aspire to be design and systems thinkers through a first-year engineering course. Using the ADDIE model, the instructional design was implemented in three modules focusing on design, systems, and integration for real-world applications. The instructional design was evaluated via course feedback surveys and focus-group interviews. Students indicated positive impacts on creative mindsets, habits of systems thinkers, and interdisciplinary awareness. However, negative comments about the course arrangement such as heavy workload and disconnection between topics were identified. Suggestions from students, challenges faced by the instructors, and recommended practices are discussed. In times of increasing need to reform higher education due to digitization and artificial intelligence, this study provides a timely investigation of a new project-based and mindset-focused pedagogy in design and systems thinking education.

Constructing in Minecraft in Primary School as a Boundary-Crossing Practice,"This study explores the educational adoption of Minecraft as a boundary-crossing practice in primary schools. Previous research indicates that Minecraft can facilitate connections between educational activities and students’ out-of-school experiences, promoting the development of skills such as creativity, innovation, and collaboration. Using a qualitative approach, this study analyzed group interviews with 37 primary school students who participated in a Minecraft-based school project. The analysis focused on instances of boundary crossing associated with the Minecraft activity, allowing an examination of how various socio-cultural boundaries were overcome. The results suggest that educational activities in Minecraft can facilitate connections between school and out-of-school contexts. Moreover, the results indicate that Minecraft can serve as an interdisciplinary learning environment, enabling students to acquire knowledge and skills across diverse domains and disciplines. The analysis also underscores the significance of teachers’ design work in transforming the game into an educational resource. Overall, this article argues that the educational adoption of Minecraft has the potential to foster the construction of continuity between students’ different spheres of life, as well as prompting a reconsideration of students’ previous cultural classifications and social positions.

Do Grandparents Contribute to Their Grandchildren’s Learning through Shared Leisure Activities?,"Intergenerational leisure can be a tool to stimulate and reinforce the learning of primary school students. The aim of this study was to examine which leisure activities shared by grandparents and their grandchildren are carried out from the perception of intergenerational learning as one of the main reasons for joint practice, and its link with the grandparents’ level of education. An ad hoc questionnaire was administered to 329 students aged 6 to 12 years in the north of Spain, and a descriptive study and inferential analysis of the data were carried out. The leisure activities that students highlight the most as experiences in which they perceive that by sharing them with their grandparents, they learn from them, are board games, artistic activities, caring for plants or gardens and reading. There are only significant differences in the learning perceived by primary school students depending on the level of education of their grandparents in caring for plants or vegetable gardens, as the grandparents of children aged 6 to 12 in the northern part of Spain are more able to teach their grandchildren to care for plants or vegetable gardens when their level of education is primary education. These four activities highlighted by the grandchildren as facilitators of knowledge are very interesting instruments to stimulate and reinforce the education of primary school students, so involving grandparents in their grandchildren’s education and taking advantage of their knowledge and experience, as well as their ability to stimulate their grandchildren, is a good strategy to turn free time into valuable leisure time.

Using Generative Artificial Intelligence Tools to Explain and Enhance Experiential Learning for Authentic Assessment,"The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) requires innovative educational environments to leverage this technology effectively to address concerns like academic integrity, plagiarism, and others. Additionally, higher education needs effective pedagogies to achieve intended learning outcomes. This emphasizes the need to redesign active learning experiences in the GenAI era. Authentic assessment and experiential learning are two possible meaningful alternatives in this context. Accordingly, this article investigates how GenAI can enhance teaching and learning by constructively addressing study situations beyond conventional learning approaches and cultivating high-order skills and knowledge acquisition. This study employs thing ethnography to examine GenAI tools’ integration with authentic assessment and experiential learning and explore implementation alternatives. The results reveal insights into creating human-centered and GenAI-enhanced learning experiences within a constructive alignment. Specific examples are also provided to guide their implementation. Our contributions extend beyond the traditional use of GenAI tools as mere agents-to-write or agents-to-answer questions to become agents-to-support experiential learning for authentic assessment. These findings underscore the transformative role of GenAI tools in enhancing teaching and learning efficacy and effectiveness. The limitations in treating GenAI tools as subjects in thing ethnography are acknowledged, with potential for future implementation evaluation.

A Current Overview of the Use of Learning Analytics Dashboards,"The promise of Learning Analytics Dashboards in education is to collect, analyze, and visualize data with the ultimate ambition of improving students’ learning. Our overview of the latest systematic reviews on the topic shows a number of research trends: learning analytics research is growing rapidly; it brings to the front inequality and inclusiveness measures; it reveals an unclear path to data ownership and privacy; it provides predictions which are not clearly translated into pedagogical actions; and the possibility of self-regulated learning and game-based learning are not capitalized upon. However, as learning analytics research progresses, greater opportunities lie ahead, and a better integration between information science and learning sciences can bring added value of learning analytics dashboards in education.

Increasing Self-Concept and Decreasing Gender Stereotypes in STEM through Professional Development for Early Childhood Educators,"Starting early in life, children, especially girls, experience obstacles when it comes to developing an interest in STEM. Although early childhood (EC) educators face an important task in promoting girls (and boys) in STEM, they often face challenges in doing so. Therefore, it is crucial for EC educators to cultivate positive attitudes, self-concepts, and STEM skills. To address these identified issues, a three-month professional development program was created for EC educators. This professional development program was evaluated using a pre–post design with a focus on the self-concept and gender stereotypes of EC educators. The program involved 30 female EC educators in evaluating these aspects. The statistical analyses show positive results in enhancing educators’ self-concepts and reducing gender stereotypes over the course of this professional development program. The results suggest the potential of the blended learning design in this professional development program and indicate that this program could serve as a promising model for future interventions.

"Learning Sciences from the Past: Recovery, Study, and Cataloging of a Historical Natural History School Museum","School–museum partnerships have gained considerable attention in the academic literature in recent decades. However, their role in enhancing science education is still an under-researched topic. This work reports on the outcomes of the recovery, study, cataloging, and valorization of the 18th century geo-mineralogical collection belonging to the Collegio Nazareno, now housed at the Istituto San Giuseppe Calasanzio in Rome. The project, which was participated in by the students enrolled in the fourth- and fifth-grade high school classes, revealed rare specimens such as the mineralogical collection donated by the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II (1741–1740) in 1785. Furthermore, the laboratory activities organized from the stored samples highlighted educational approaches that helped students to cope with the complexities of authentic scientific work and cultural related issues. This work thus offers significant insights into the importance of natural history school museums as useful (and oft-forgotten) learning tools in science education.

An Exploration of How Multimodally Designed Teaching and the Creation of Digital Animations can Contribute to Six-Year-Olds’ Meaning Making in Chemistry,"Previous research shows that pupils’ participation in educational activities increases when they are allowed to use several forms of expression. Furthermore, digital media have become increasingly prominent as “carriers” of meaning in chemistry education. Based on that, this paper aims to explore ‘what is happening’ and ‘what is possible’ when six-year-old pupils participate in multimodally designed learning activities and create digital animations of water molecules and phase changes of water. This study is qualitative and draws on the frameworks of social semiotics and Designs for Learning, DfL, where teaching and learning are seen as a multimodal design. The Learning Design Sequence model, developed within DfL is used as a basis for the lesson design and as an analytical tool. The analyzed data were generated by filming when pupils participated in multimodal learning activities, created digital animations, and participated in meta-reflective discussions regarding their digital animations. The main findings are that multimodally designed lessons can increase pupils’ meaning making in chemistry, that the creation of digital animations may both increase pupils’ participation and support their meaning making, and that meta-reflection of pupils’ representations is an important part of the lesson design.

Factors Associated with Resilience among Thai Nursing Students in the Context of Clinical Education: A Cross-Sectional Study,"Resilience aids nursing students in dealing with adversities during their nursing education. This study examined the relationship between nursing students’ resilience and relevant variables in the context of clinical education. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect data from 319 undergraduate nursing students in Northeast Thailand. The Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the Learning Experience Scale or the Personal Responsibility Orientation to Self-Direction in Learning Scale, and the Stressors in Nursing Students scale were administered. A multiple regression analysis was performed for factors presumed to be associated with resilience. Results reported that Thai nursing students’ average resilience score was 71.79 ± 16.33. Multiple regression analysis indicated factors associated with resilience, in which social support (β = 0.354, p < 0.001, 95%CI: 0.240 to 0.469) and self-directed learning (β = 0.787, p < 0.001, 95%CI: 0.606 to 0.968) showed a positive association, while stress (β = −0.083, p = 0.025, 95%CI: −0.083 to −0.006) had a negative association. The final model accounted for 43.4% of the variance in the resilience score. In conclusion, self-directed learning, social support, and perceived stress among nursing students during clinical education are associated with their resilience.

Designing for Social Justice: A Decolonial Exploration of How to Develop EdTech for Refugees,"This paper reflects on the lived experiences of young refugees located in Pakistan and Rwanda when interacting with education technology (EdTech) during and following displacement. We offer a broad decolonial commentary on issues related to the design and development of EdTech initiatives for refugees, noting some of the historical trends prevalent in the education and emergencies sector. We are guided by questions such as: Why EdTech to start with? Who designs the products? Where are they designed? How are they designed? And, which power dynamics are at play during the design process? From this, we draw on qualitative data generated through three focus groups, where we explore young refugees’ experiences of EdTech. The focus group included a creative element inviting participants to imagine what a liberatory EdTech practice would look like. We aim to illustrate the practical implications of design choices taken by EdTech developers and, from this, recommend a set of justice-centred design principles for developers of EdTech in refugee contexts. These insights relate specifically to the experiences of refugees in Rwanda and Pakistan, though we also discuss the implications of these learnings for other contexts.

A Gender Bias in Curriculum-Based Measurement across Content Domains: Insights from a German Study,"By immediately responding to achievement progress data, teachers can improve students’ performance by using curriculum-based measurement. However, there are studies showing that teachers are prone to make biased judgments about the students providing the data. The present investigation experimentally examined whether pre-service teachers in Germany were biased by the use of gender stereotypes when judging students’ achievement derived from progress data. N = 100 pre-service teachers received graphs that depicted the development of either oral reading fluency or math achievement of girls and boys over a time interval of 11 weeks. The results obtained confirmed the hypotheses partially. The participants did not favor girls over boys on average. However, they judged achievement in reading to be higher for girls than for boys, and math achievement to be higher for boys than for girls. The results suggest that gender stereotypes (boys are good at math, girls are good at reading) are still prevalent in pre-service teachers.

Three Approaches to Using Mixed Reality Simulations for Teacher Preparation and Recruitment of Future Teachers,"Mixed reality simulations have versatility in both the preparation as well as the recruitment of future teachers. We describe three approaches that have led to successful outcomes for general and special education preservice teachers, as well as in the recruitment of future teacher candidates from the high school level. First, we explored the use of TeachLivE™ to enhance special education teacher candidates’ behavior observation skills when conducting functional behavior assessments. Second, we studied the impact of different simulation methods on early childhood candidates’ preparedness to communicate with parents and caregivers about sensitive topics. Finally, we utilized TeachLivE™ as a recruitment tool to engage current high-achieving high school students in the teaching and reflection process as part of their on-campus dual credit program. In all cases, candidates and students valued the simulation experiences, recognizing the opportunity to deliver instruction in supportive environments with immediate feedback, coaching, and practice opportunities.

Shaping Entrepreneurial Attitudes among Young Children on the Basis of the “Entrepreneurial Kids” International Project,"Entrepreneurship is one of the key competencies that should be developed in the educational process. However, in the form of a specific subject with particular objectives and outcomes, it only appears in secondary school. Younger children are involved in direct or indirect entrepreneurial activities in a variety of activities. However, these are not planned and not evaluated. Preschool and early primary school children also cannot benefit from the offer of projects or competitions outside of school due to the limited number of opportunities and because they often focus on economic aspects rather than the development of soft skills, which in children aged 3–10 seem to be more important for their overall development. This article presents an example of an initiative that can fill these gaps, i.e., the “Entrepreneurial Kids” project. The theoretical foundations of this project, its course, and its results to date are discussed.

"(Dis)connection between Multiculturalism, Higher Education and Health: Experiences of International Students in Portugal during the Covid-19 Pandemic","Multiculturalism may point to the idea of ‘cohesion in diversity’, but if differentiated institutional policies and practices do not accompany it, it may contribute to promoting or deepening inequalities between different groups/cultures. Given the increase in students’ international mobility, multicultural awareness in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) must be considered. Based on this idea, this article aims to answer: (i) what were the main health problems (physical and mental) that international students (IS) in Portugal experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic; and (ii) how they perceived their health rights in Portugal. To this end, we used data from an online survey, which was made available to all IS enrolled in a Portuguese HEI between April and May 2020, and from 22 online interviews conducted between September 2020 and January 2021 with some of these students. The results showed that the pandemic impacted the mental health of IS; fear, anxiety and stress were some of the symptoms experienced. Portuguese public health services have been perceived as untrustworthy by IS, and some students’ experience reinforces the untrustworthiness. The research shows the (dis)connection between multiculturalism, health, and HEIs. While HEIs promote multiculturalism, they have failed to provide answers in the field of health that take into account the specificities of their different student groups.

A Typology of Multiple School Leadership,"In facing the challenges of huge transformations in different areas of society, many educators, policy makers, social leaders, researchers and other stakeholders may doubt how schools and their leadership and management remain relevant to and effective for the future of education. Given that multiple school functions are needed to serve society at different levels, the required roles in school leadership are inevitably multiple, diverse and demanding. In past decades, many studies have been conducted with a focus on some aspects of leadership functions and processes. Unfortunately, there is a lack of a typology of school leadership to map out comprehensive leadership profiles and understand their multiple characteristics for leading school development and effectiveness in a fast-changing environment. Based on the framework of multiple school effectiveness, this paper aims to propose a typology of multiple school leadership that can provide a new, comprehensive way to re-conceptualize the multiple nature and characteristics of school leadership in a complicated context. Depending on the rationalities, concerns, actions, outcomes and contexts of leadership in practice, the typology of multiple school leadership may include six models: technological leadership, economic leadership, social leadership, political leadership, cultural leadership, and learning leadership. Within this typology, new possibilities and approaches to school leadership can be drawn for research, practice and development towards the future.

Exploring German High School Students’ Conceptual Learning Pathways of Space and Place,"Space and place, fundamental concepts in geography, uniquely contribute to the development of students’ geographical thinking. Despite this, these concepts are underrepresented in German geography classrooms, partly due to a distinct lack of empirical evidence concerning the learning processes associated with learning complex geographical concepts. This study employed videography to explore how n = 64 grade twelve students from various school types in Germany develop a more sophisticated understanding of space and place during a 90 min. teaching experiment. To delve into the micro-level of students’ learning processes, qualitative content analysis was employed to analyse the data. The subsequent detailed reconstruction of an individual learning pathway unveiled several pivotal moments. Notably, the concepts demonstrated significant potential for restructuring students’ existing knowledge into a more conceptual and systematic framework. Moreover, barriers to learning were identified as well. For example, conceptual interferences between the concepts of space/place and other geographical key concepts such as sustainability were observed, partially impeding the formation of a clear conceptual framework in students’ minds. The results provide insights for teaching implications, such as emphasising a single key concept to avoid conceptual interferences, and suggest further research avenues, including longitudinal studies to empirically derive learning progressions related to space and place.

Social Media and Artificial Intelligence: Critical Conversations and Where Do We Go from Here?,"Prior to and during the pandemic, social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook emerged as dynamic online spaces for diverse communities facilitating engagement and learning. The authors of this article have explored the use of social media with a focus on Twitter for engagement and student-centered design of online courses in higher education. As with all technology, social media is also riddled with complex issues and unfortunately, is increasingly considered unsafe. Students have often been hesitant in their use of social media, especially for coursework and unfortunately, this hesitation has only worsened. Considering this and recent developments, social media has become a questionable tool for use in education, yet remains integral to the lives of many, both personally and professionally. The emergence and popularity of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT, Lensa AI, and Canva Magic Write present new challenges and opportunities and cannot be avoided by the educational communities. Is there hope for social media and AI tools during these uncertain times? Through the combination of a current literature review and qualitative collaborative autoethnographic research, the authors take a step back and engage in critical conversations about what we have learned from our uses of social media for engagement and learning in our online courses, with a focus on (1) the intentional uses of social media, (2) the challenges and concerning issues of social media tools, and (3) exploring the implications of artificial intelligence. Centering on the theme of “hope,” the authors navigate these educational and technological landscapes and answer the question “where do we go from here?” The authors are faculty at a southwest border university teaching preservice and in-service teachers alongside those who want to learn more about education and design with learning technologies. Their voices represent faculty, teachers, and students who are engaging with and immediately impacted by the challenges and opportunities of rapidly advancing technologies.

"The Role of Self-Efficacy, Motivation, and Connectedness in Dropout Intention in a Sample of Italian College Students","Dropout is a critical concern in higher education, with a considerable number of students leaving within the first two years of university. Dropout affects students’ well-being and their academic and career prospects, and institutions’ retention and graduation rates. The aim of this study was to explore the mediating role of motivation and cognitive strategies for learning in the relationship among self-efficacy, connectedness, and university dropout intention. A total of 790 Italian college freshmen were involved in this study. The sample was recruited through a web survey consisting of the Academic Motivation Scale, Perceived School Self-Efficacy Scale, University Connectedness Scale, and Self-Regulated Knowledge Scale-University. The freshmen’s intentions to drop out were assessed with five questions. The average age of the freshmen was 20.9 years, most of them were female, and were attending a degree program in the medical area. The results show that self-efficacy is the most important predictor of dropout intentions, followed by university connectedness. Self-regulated knowledge has an important role in predicting dropout intention by acting as a mediator between self-efficacy and motivation.This study underlines the importance of investing in training and orientation interventions in order to develop the skills to face the university path, increasing self-efficacy, motivation, and consequently students’ well-being.

A Systematic Scoping Review on Research Focusing on Professionals’ Attitudes toward School Attendance Problems,"This systematic scoping review was conducted to determine the extent of existing research on professionals’ attitudes toward school attendance problems (SAPs), including school refusal (SR), truancy (TR), school withdrawal (SW), and school exclusion (SE), in basic education. Five databases (ERIC, Academic Search Ultimate, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) were systematically searched for relevant literature. Forty-five studies met the inclusion criteria that were set prior to the search and were eligible for inclusion. The results of this systematic scoping review reveal that there has been a continuous increase in studies addressing professionals’ attitudes toward SAPs since 2000, with the greatest number of studies published after 2019 and in Europe. Most studies were descriptive, cross-sectional, and used a qualitative approach and the most common informants were school-based professionals (i.e., teachers, school administrators, and other school staff). The included studies used a variety of concepts referring to SAPs and types of SAPs, underlining the present challenges in terminology and definitions that characterize the research field. The results of this review contribute to identifying gaps in knowledge and offer guidelines for future research as a prerequisite to enhance the contemporary comprehension of SAPs in research and in practice.

Improving Elementary Pre-Service Teachers’ Science Teaching Self-Efficacy through Garden-Based Technology Integration,"School gardens and outdoor learning spaces are increasingly available to support authentic, student-centered exploration in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Integrating technology tools into school garden spaces in alignment with modern agricultural practices can support inquiry-based learning in which students engage in science practices such as collecting and analyzing data. However, educators currently lack the necessary knowledge, skills, and instructional support to enact technology-rich, garden-based STEM learning experiences. The Garden TOOLS program was designed to support teachers in leveraging technology to support inquiry-based teaching (IBT) in outdoor learning spaces. In this paper, we examine the impact of combining Garden TOOLS professional development workshops with lesson plan implementation in a practicum setting on elementary pre-service teachers’ (PSTs) science teaching self-efficacy. We administered the STEBI-B pre- and post-intervention and assessed change in the STEBI-B subscales, personal science teaching efficacy (PSTE), and science teaching outcome expectancy (STOE). Participants included thirty-nine elementary PSTs enrolled in a 300-level science methods course in the rural Midwest. Garden TOOLS professional development workshop participants saw a statistically significant increase from pre- to post-workshop in their PSTE. Participants who also implemented the Garden TOOLS lesson showed both an increase in PSTE and STOE.

Priorities for Pan-American Geography Education: Needs and Trends,"Geography education research in Latin America is uneven in terms of its thematic focus and country-level contributions. Research demonstrates the necessity for a region-wide prioritization of geography education themes that builds on existing scholarship and adapts to emerging needs and trends. The Pan-American Institute for Geography and History, a scholarly society, established a research team with a four-year charge of advancing geography education in the region. Titled “Geographic Literacy for the Countries of the Americas”, the initiative develops research agendas that encompass the diversity of definitions and criteria, scholarly activities, and curricular resources across countries. The purpose of this study is to follow the process of identifying geography education research priorities involving scholars representing most countries in the region; describe the priorities and activities identified by project team members; and discuss emerging long-term research agendas. The study uses a descriptive research design to describe the process in general and to specify the outcomes. Results show the prioritization of the four areas as follows: teaching geography online, teaching geography face-to-face, methodological foundations of geographic education, and connecting geography and education stakeholders. Activities and research agendas within these categories include both traditional, longstanding themes and emerging themes related to recent global crises and technological innovations.

"“A World of Possibilities”: The Future of Technology in Higher Education, Insights from the COVID-19 Experience","During the emergency online pivot, two faculties (i.e., divisions) of a large Irish university aimed to document insights about teaching and learning in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. An anonymous online survey of all teaching staff within each faculty was undertaken, some of the results of which are presented here. Key findings focus on the use of online technology in higher education, demonstrating the differential impacts on different disciplines and year groups, and pointing to levels of educator readiness and the need for focused professional development and training to prepare staff for integrating online learning to ensure satisfactory outcomes. The emergency online pivot led to significant progress in the use of technology in higher education, and greater academic staff recognition of the benefits and scope afforded by technology. Arising from their COVID-19 experiences, staff expressed a strong preference for blended learning as opposed to learning taking place either fully online or in-person. The potential role of hybrid learning in ongoing efforts towards sustainability was also noted. Many of our findings align with recent research, which is discussed throughout. We argue that a ‘one size fits all’ approach to online education is not appropriate, with greater nuance required and consideration of the rapidly changing educational landscape and issues of environmental sustainability.

The Influence of Gender and Age on the Open-Mindedness of University Students,"Open-mindedness (OM) is one of the select groups of 21st-century soft skills that are lacking in the university curricula. Our aim was to analyse the OM level of our university students and study the influence of gender and age on OM. To do so, we used an ex post facto experimental design, a snowball sampling technique, an OM questionnaire administered to 493 students and statistical techniques of data mining and multiple linear regression. The results show medium–low levels of OM and higher scores in those below 49 years of age and female gender. The variable that most influenced the variability of OM was age (82%), compared to gender (18%). The practical implications of these results aim to promote a more inclusive, active and higher-quality university education that integrates OM, together with other competencies, to make our students more competitive academically and favour their entry into the labour market.

Exploring Staff–Student Partnership in Curriculum Design,"Collaboration between staff and students for improved curriculum design is presented as highly beneficial in many contexts. In particular, Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is seen as facilitating co-design and collaboration. However, students tend not to be actively involved in curriculum change, especially in whole programme design or review. Furthermore, few studies consider partnership with students in the context of ESD inclusion, which was the focus for this collaboration. The aim of this study was to explore staff and student perceptions of participating in a collaborative approach to the review and development of the undergraduate law curriculum in a university in the UK. A developmental evaluation using mixed methods was used to study the expectations and experiences of students and staff through a process of curriculum review and change to incorporate ESD. Our findings demonstrate the rewards of a collaborative process incorporating diverse perspectives. However, they also highlight barriers for students and staff, including perceptions of risk associated with student involvement in the process, and we offer reflections on navigating these potential risks.

Boundary Devices for Reflexive Teachers,"Reflexivity appears to be a key focus when designing teachers’ training; therefore, designers and trainers need to plan and put in place situated and proactive learning contexts in which reflexivity is supported by specific participatory devices. During a 1st level master’s degree for teachers and educators, based on the Trialogical Learning Approach, learners are involved in several collaborative activities to create meaningful objects. Divided into 14 groups of four members covering specific roles (the coordinator, the researcher, the storyboarder, and the diarist), the participants collaboratively built a multimedia teaching resource about a chosen methodological–didactic theme. Applying a qualitative approach, this study analyzes the online diaries compiled during the activity to understand its impact as a “meta” boundary object able to support reflexivity on one’s professionalism. The content analysis focused on analyzing how objects and practices enabled learning and participation and how students’ identity evolved during group work. The results show that a diary may act as a reflexive tool, allowing for the externalization of the processes that underly the construction of individual and collective knowledge and promoting reflection on practices and identity positioning within a community composed of professionals working in educational fields. In the end, practical implications and recommendations are provided to enhance the reflexive diaries both in teachers’ training and in the daily practice with students.

Exploring Children’s Online Summer Camp Adventures through Creativity and Problem Solving,"Summer camps can help children continue to learn beyond school, build knowledge, keep their learning skills sharp, and help them prepare for the following school year. This paper presents participants’, facilitators’, and researchers’ experiences in a “Problem Solvers Camp” held in the Maker Lab at an Ontario University. A total of 12 junior students participated in a one-week summer camp, during which the participants developed plausible solutions for mathematical and instant problems using their creativity while learning some mathematical concepts. The creative learning spiral (CLS) model was adopted while designing the learning activities. Throughout the camp, children had the opportunity to work with virtual tech tools to design, create, and play to complete their challenges. Afterward, they shared their work for feedback and generated new ideas to promote their creative learning. The data were collected through observations, participants’ work, and their portfolios to highlight the campers’ experiences throughout the camp. On the last day of the camp, the researchers also ran focus group interviews. Data analysis showed that CLS might offer engaging environments that enhance children’s creative and reflective thinking skills to solve real-life problems. This study enabled children to engage in all stages of the CLS during problem solving, encouraging the exchange of ideas and opinions. The implementation of the CLS model also has the potential to inspire creativity and enhance learners’ fluency and elaboration skills, especially when complemented by technological or coding tools.

"Learning in Transit: Crossing Borders, Waiting, and Waiting to Cross","Recent U.S. policy changes have contributed to longer waiting periods for migrant families in Mexican border cities. This study centers on four Honduran families enrolled in the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) policy, also referred to as ‘Remain in Mexico,’ while undergoing prolonged waiting periods in the Mexican border town of Monterrey, Nuevo Léon. Centering on young people’s voices, we ask what they learn during this prolonged period of transit. Through ethnographic and digital participatory storytelling interviews, we illustrate how children learned about the politics of border crossing through fraught interactions with im/migration officials, prolonged periods of immobility, and evolving understandings of legality. Building on theories of ‘border thinking’ and ‘politicized funds of knowledge,’ we highlight ways that young people employed their evolving understandings of national borders and the legal contours of their transborder asylum process, while protecting themselves and their families from danger and discrimination. We argue that transit is not simply time that young people are forced to endure; rather, the experience of forced transit is constitutive of young people’s learning about state power and their evolving understanding of borders, rights, and belonging.

Physical Exercise and Older People: Always a Happy Relationship? Four Qualitative Reflections to Deepen Understanding,"In this paper, I recall reflections from and discussions with both older people who exercise actively and with personal trainers who specialise in working with older people to address two essential elements that should be clarified: First, what are we talking about when we discuss sport, physical exercise and physical activity, especially when we relate them to older people? Second, the benefits of exercise are known, but what are the margins and precautions that this group of people should consider, and even the damage that physical exercise can cause to them? Based on qualitative data that are taken from different ethnographic works, four areas are considered: What does it mean to train as a senior?; are injuries inevitable?; the dangers of having an athlete’s identity; and the hazards of body-image ideals. This work gives voice to older athletes and their coaches, and contributes to studies on physical activity, older people and wellbeing.

Hot Spots of Gun Violence in the Era of Focused Deterrence: A Space-Time Analysis of Shootings in South Philadelphia,"Gun and street group violence remains a serious problem in cities across the United States and the focused deterrence strategy has been a widely applied law enforcement intervention to reduce it. Although two meta-analytical studies concluded that the intervention had a significant effect on violence, questions remain about how violence changes across space and time during and after the intervention. This study applies novel geospatial analyses to assess spatiotemporal changes in gun violence before, during, and after the implementation of Philadelphia Focused Deterrence. Emerging hot spot analysis employing Space-Time cubes of ten annual time bins (2009–2018) at the Thiessen polygon level was used to detect and categorize patterns. The analyses revealed a non-significant decreasing trend across the ten-year period. Furthermore, there were ninety-three statistically significant hot spots categorized into four hot spot patterns: fourteen new hot spots; twenty-three consecutive; one persistent; and fifty-three sporadic. There was no evidence showing statistically significant hot spots for the “diminishing” pattern. Knowledge of these patterns that emerge across micro-locations can be used by law enforcement practitioners to complement data-driven problem solving and fine tune these strategies and other place-based programming. Policymakers can use findings to prioritize resources when developing complementary prevention and intervention efforts by tailoring those efforts to the different emergent patterns.

Situated Pedagogy in Danish Daycare—The Politics of Everyday Life,"This article analyzes the possibilities and obstacles in pedagogical practices in ECEC (Early Childhood Education and Care) in relation to developing relevant opportunities for participation for all children, by supporting their own engagements in order to expand their action possibilities. Over the last decades, the political agendas in the Nordic as well as other OECD countries have been led by an increasing focus on learning goals and standardized professional procedures, at the expense of a more situated and flexible pedagogy following children’s own engagements. When concerns arise about children’s well-being, development, and/or learning, this tendency seems to intensify, as descriptions of concerns are often based on assessments of children’s individual (dis-)abilities, while investigations of children’s own engagements and reasons for actions are seldom conducted. From a theoretical standpoint in critical psychology and social practice theory, we discuss collaborative processes among children and adults in relation to institutional conditions as inherently political, in the sense that the distribution of different access to social resources and opportunities for participation for different children is negotiated through such daily exchanges and therefore also involves questions about democracy. We explore the everyday life practices of children and professionals, analyzing how, through everyday practice, they constantly work on maintaining, reproducing, and transgressing the standardized demands. To understand such processes, we suggest a conceptual focus on the politics of everyday life and situated pedagogy.

“Not Everyone Can Become a Rocket Scientist”: Decolonising Children’s Rights in Ethnic Minority Childhoods in Norway,"This paper uses a case study to critically reflect on contemporary discourses in Norway connected to ethnic minority childhoods and children’s rights to education and work. Based on a narrative interview with an ethnic minority girl, Sadja (aged 16), who is in state custody and lives with a foster family, we use a decolonial lens to explore the tensions in expectations and rights in her life and education. The tensions encountered are situated along three axes. The first axis illustrates tensions related to education, work, and responsibilities, as Sadja’s family responsibilities are perceived by teachers and child welfare workers as preventing her from having “a proper childhood”. The second axis explores tensions connected to independence, educational choice, and “belonging to the state”, where Sadja experiences that being in state custody results in being unable to “follow her dream”. The third axis reflects the tensions between parental expectations of “dreaming big” versus her surrounding environment’s anticipation of her simply getting a job. In sum, Sadja’s experiences suggest that contemporary Western discourses—such as individualism, self-autonomy, and children as human capital—paradoxically curtail the educational rights and trajectories of ethnic minority children in foster care in Norway in unforeseen and unfortunate ways.

Disability Theatre as Critical Participatory Action Research: Lessons for Inclusive Research,"Informed by critical disability studies and disability justice, this article describes the reflections of two university researchers co-researching with self-advocates (individuals with intellectual disability), theatre artists, researchers, and a community living society to create social justice disability theatre as critical participatory research (CPAR), demonstrating how disability theatre can contribute to and advance inclusive research practice. Disability justice-informed theatre as CPAR has direct relevance to people with intellectual disabilities; offers a platform where self-advocates’ diverse ways to communicate and be in the world are honoured and taken up as resources to the research and community; and can generate mentorship opportunities for self-advocates to learn, practice, and develop research skills. Significances include showing how the theatre creation process (devising, developing, and refining scenes) is research in itself and how tensions are recognized as sites of possibility. Future research should explore how increasing pathways to communication, co-creation of KT strategies, and protocols for power sharing and problem solving within disability theatre as CPAR impact the roles, outcomes, and experiences of disabled and non-disabled researchers and audience members.

The Violent Aspect of Widowhood Rites in the South African Context,"In African culture, widowhood is frequently accompanied by rites that must be carried out by the widow. Widows are compelled to carry out these rites and may not feel comfortable executing them since they involve violence. The minority who dares to refuse to participate can face serious consequences because they are persecuted by their families and society. Research shows that widows suffer from fear and coercion, stigmatisation, dehumanising experiences, movement and social restrictions, and exposure to harmful traditional practices. This article examines violent aspects of widowhood rites within the South African context. A qualitative study that examined oppressive structures and how they impacted social injustice and the marginalisation of widows was employed. The data were collected from a purposeful sample of widows in Gauteng province, South Africa. Semi-structured interviews were used to gather data from 28 widows, which were then subjected to thematic analysis. Our findings showed that widows were subjected to painful widowhood rites, which were frequently performed against their preferences. The rites affected them both physically and emotionally. The article recommends that policies be put in place to safeguard the rights of widows and protect them from exploitative cultural beliefs.

Research Trends in the Study of Acceptability of Digital Mental Health-Related Interventions: A Bibliometric and Network Visualisation Analysis,"The acceptability of digital health interventions is a multifaceted concept that is central to user engagement. It is influenced by cultural and social norms and it is, also, a key consideration for intervention development and evaluation. For this reason, it is important to have a clear overview of how research in digital interventions’ acceptability has evolved, what type of measures or assessments have been most frequently utilised, and what may be the implications for the knowledge area and future research directions. The purpose of this bibliometric and network visualization analysis was to explore the main research patterns in the study of the acceptability of digital mental health interventions and highlight the key characteristics of knowledge production on this topic. The Web of Science was searched for relevant primary studies, with 990 documents selected for inclusion in this bibliometric analysis. Publications’ metrics, text and author keyword analysis, and bibliographical coupling of the documents provided insights into how technological developments, specific research interests, research priorities, and contexts have shaped research in the field. The main differentiation in acceptability approaches emanated from the studies’ research designs, the stage of intervention development and evaluation, and the extent to which there was a focus on user attitudes, experience, and engagement. These differentiations further indicate the importance of having clarity as to what concepts or elements of acceptability a study addresses as well as approaches that have the potential to address the complexities of acceptability.

Digital Access to Judicial Services in the Brazilian Amazon: Barriers and Potential,"This study investigates the influence of geographical barriers and the challenges and advantages presented by information and communication technologies on digital governance within the judicial branch in the Brazilian Amazon region. The primary objective is to provide diagnoses and recommendations that can inform the construction of research for the development of policies aimed at enhancing access to judicial services by riverside populations. The methodology initially employed was a comprehensive literature review on digital governance within the judiciary and access to justice for vulnerable groups in a geographical context. Subsequently, a qualitative study was conducted, employing participant observation in the riverside communities of Itapéua and Boca do Una, situated along the Jaurucu River within the Porto de Moz District in the state of Pará. The insights garnered from respondent perceptions and participant observations were synthesized to formulate five key dimensions for digital governance and access to justice within Amazonian communities: (1) one’s experience with justice, (2) access to information, (3) geographical barriers, (4) user-friendliness of technology, and (5) resources and infrastructure supporting technology use. The study concludes that there are compelling indications that tailored digital governance and technology utilization by the judiciary, adapted to regional nuances, can significantly contribute to streamlining access to judicial services.

Paramilitary Conflict in Colombia: A Case Study of Economic Causes of Conflict Recidivism,"Following the peace accord on 26 September 2016 between the Colombian government and the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC), significant structural issues persisted in Colombia, such as state fragility, land distribution challenges, and rural impoverishment, all of which jeopardized sustainable peace. Previous disarmament events indicated potential shifts in violence and recidivism rates among ex-combatants. This paper aims to determine the likelihood that, in the post-conflict era with FARC, these ex-combatants would rearm themselves into new criminal factions. Employing a methodology by Paul Collier, the study utilized logit, probit, and panel data models with both fixed and random effects to evaluate the recidivism risk at the municipal level. A 1% increase in per capita municipal income decreased conflict probability due to the increased opportunity cost of disrupting economic endeavors. Conversely, 1% increases in potential conflict benefits from tax revenue and natural resource proceeds raised the probability of conflict by 40% and 17%, respectively. Key results indicate that economic advancement, as measured by per capita income, reduced the duration of paramilitary presence, whereas revenue from taxes and natural resources extended it at the municipal level in Colombia.

Teachers’ Perception of Some Effects of the COVID-19 Lockdown: The Case Study of Ludovika University of Public Service,"The COVID-19 lockdown has had serious consequences, including rethinking higher education. The study aims to enhance the knowledge base of online education and academic integrity through a case study of the Ludovika University of Public Service (LUPS), Budapest, Hungary. The research aimed to assess the teachers’ experience with distance learning and examinations, including the change in workload, digital competencies, Moodle, Turnitin, and other software used during and after the lockdown. This paper summarizes the university-level policy changes induced during the lockdown, covering the introduction of emergency distance teaching and online examinations in academic integrity at the university. Two years after the first lockdown, the researchers made a survey (n = 145) about the continuation of the introduced solutions. The results show that a remarkable reordering started while the technical and technological backgrounds were available for the changes. The teachers could feel a significant increase in workload with distance education and have low trust in maintaining the standards of academic integrity. However, the research shows moderate and low levels of digital competencies in the majority of teachers, which clearly defines the most crucial task leading to success. Maintaining the monitoring system with objective indicators of the development and the opinions of the interested parties is essential for successful strategies in the field.

Examining People’s Experiences of Working in Collaborative Relationships While Conducting Inclusive Research Involving Persons with Intellectual Disabilities,"This study examined the experiences of working in collaborative relationships while conducting inclusive research involving persons with intellectual disabilities. More specifically, the study explored work relationships, social relationships, and factors that influence collaboration within inclusive research teams. Interviews were conducted with nine researchers with intellectual disabilities, eight academic researchers, and nine principal investigators who were all involved in six inclusive research projects together. The analysis of the interviews produced four themes: (1) the diverse nature of the involvement of researchers with intellectual disabilities; (2) the significance of involving researchers with intellectual disabilities within academic research; (3) shaping equity in research projects; and (4) stereotyping hindering collaborations with researchers with intellectual disabilities. These findings have implications for research and practice, both in terms of promoting inclusive research and facilitating the meaningful participation of persons with intellectual disabilities within various aspects of society, including education, employment, healthcare, and social activities.

New Developments in Geopolitics: A Reassessment of Theories after 2023,"The scope of this article is to make a synthesis of the theory of geopolitics with new trends and characteristics of the new global environment. Traditional geopolitical theories are established on the basis of sovereign states. The starting point of many theories is for sovereign states to compete for world hegemony, or to gain an advantage in competition with their opponents. Geopolitical research also mostly starts from the interests of the country. However, as global environmental changes, transnational crimes, terrorism, information security, and other non-traditional security threats have become common threats to human society, their impact also crosses borders and has global characteristics, which also means solving geopolitical issues. Thinking needs to change from a national perspective to a global perspective. On the other hand, as the international community pays more and more attention to human rights, the challenge of human rights to sovereignty has become an unavoidable reality in current international politics. With the progress of the times, the protection and respect of civil rights has become the basic consensus of the international community. Nowadays, the issue of virtual rights such as carbon emission rights have also been included in the geopolitics theory, creating a strong shift of paradigm towards a renewed theory.

Territorial Cooperation and Cross-Border Development: The Portuguese Dynamics,"This paper explores the effectiveness of cross-border cooperation programmes between Spain and Portugal, focusing on their impact and outcomes in Portuguese regions. Drawing on a comprehensive analysis of the programmes, the study examines the socio-economic dynamics in border regions, including job creation, population trends, and investment patterns. The research employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative data analysis. We argue that the cross-border territorial cooperation between Spain and Portugal has played a significant role in fostering regional development and addressing common challenges. While the concerted efforts have shown positive results in terms of economic growth and employment, they have not been sufficient to reverse the regressive demographic trends. Thus, it is essential to strengthen cooperation mechanisms, invest in human capital, and foster innovation so that the two countries can work together to create sustainable and inclusive development across their shared border regions.

Life Story Research with People Aging with Intellectual Disabilities: An Adaptation of the Lifeline Interview Method,"A key feature of inclusive research is the accessibility of research procedures to meaningfully engage people with intellectual disabilities in research processes. Creating accessible research procedures requires innovations in methods traditionally used in research. This paper describes how the Lifeline Interview Method by Assink and Schroots was adapted and implemented in a study using life story research to better understand the experiences of older adults with intellectual disabilities. Twelve adults with intellectual disabilities over the age of 50 participated between two and seven times in interviews about their life histories. The interviewer assisted in the construction of timelines of key events in the participants’ individual life stories, and the participants decorated their lifelines throughout the course of the interviews. The lifeline process was an effective tool to engage the participants in the research process, support participation, and provide access for people with intellectual disabilities to retrieve their life experiences. Challenges in the lifeline process included barriers to gathering sufficient information to construct timelines and gatekeepers withholding access to information.

"Life Satisfaction, Courage, and Career Adaptability in a Group of Italian Workers","Today’s work market is both unsteady and unpredictable, and this requires taking urgent and practical actions aiming at creating work opportunities and “better” jobs, promoting a social and solidarity economy, and encouraging the development of moral strength in the workplace. From the Life Design approach perspective, our study examines two variables necessary to cope with the current labor market, courage, and career adaptability, and their role in life satisfaction. Through courage, a full mediational model between life satisfaction and career adaptability was tested in the 525 (291 men and 234 women) employees involved in the present study. Results support the mediational model. Mainly, life satisfaction was predicted indirectly by career adaptability through courage. Such outcome has important implications for practice and highlights the need to support workers in planning their life design by developing career adaptability and workers’ voluntary feeling to act, according to different levels of fear, when facing a threat to the achievement of a significant result or objective, which in turn will positively influence their feelings of life satisfaction.

"Use of Social Media, Satisfaction with Body Image, and the Risk of Manifesting Eating Disorders","Eating disorders in adolescents are an increasingly important issue nowadays. Although they have been shown to be a pathology with multifactorial causes, the objective of our study is to determine the degree of influence that body dissatisfaction and the use of social media (time and type) might have on the risk of manifesting eating disorders. To perform this, the Sick Control One Fat Food scale was used as part of a randomized survey carried out among 12 schools in Almería (Spain). The sample consisted of 605 students in Compulsory Secondary Education between the ages of 12 and 17 years (M = 14.27; SD = 1.44), 48.42% female and 51.52% male. Cross-tabulation tables were constructed to observe the relationship of sex and age with the risk of manifesting EDs, and, subsequently, a two-factor ANOVA was performed using the risk of suffering from an eating disorder as a dependent variable. The results show that 29.3% of the respondents express an elevated risk of suffering from an eating disorder. There are no significant differences regarding sex, but there are differences regarding age. It was also observed that dissatisfaction with body image is a significant risk factor, but not the time that young people spend on social media. Furthermore, the type of content displayed on social media has a significant influence, both independently and together with body dissatisfaction. The main conclusion highlighted in this study relates to the importance of self-perceived body image (satisfaction and dissatisfaction) and its relationship with the type of content seen on social media. For this reason, it is essential to work on self-esteem at an early age as well as learn to value others and oneself beyond just the physical.

"Post-Traumatic Growth, Resilience and Social-Ecological Synergies: Some Reflections from a Study on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence","The concept of post-traumatic growth (PTG) continues to generate significant interest, as reflected in the increasing number of studies. This article makes two novel contributions to existing scholarship on PTG. First, it seeks to demonstrate that the common framing of PTG as positive psychological change is too narrow. To do so, it looks to research on resilience and highlights the shift from person-centred understandings of resilience to more relational approaches that situate the concept in the interactions and dynamics between individuals and their social ecologies (environments). The article’s core argument is that there are social-ecological synergies between resilience and PTG, which, in turn, are highly relevant to how we think about and study growth. Second, the article empirically develops this argument by drawing on a larger study involving victims-/survivors of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia and Uganda. It is important to note in this regard that there are no major studies of PTG focused on CRSV, just as scholarship on CRSV has given little attention to PTG (or indeed resilience).

Transformational Leadership Qualities of Effective Grassroots Refugee-Led Organizations,"This qualitative study investigates the behaviors and strategies of effective leadership teams within ethnic community-based organizations (ECBOs) operating in the United States that consist of leaders who are themselves former refugees. Through analysis of four focus group interviews, each with three to five leaders from local Bhutanese, Burundian, Congolese, and Syrian communities, we identified ways in which these leaders exhibit transformational leadership behaviors proposed by established frameworks. Results reveal that effective ECBO leaders exhibit strong transformational leadership qualities, such as empowering community members, modeling behavior, and projecting a community vision. The study emphasizes the unique context of ECBOs and their leaders, showcasing their thoughtfulness, competency, and profound awareness of community members’ backgrounds. The implications include recognizing and valuing the skills of ECBO leaders and considering formal support mechanisms. This study contributes insights into the leadership exhibited within local community organizations serving refugee populations—enhancing our understanding of quality leadership among grassroots refugee organizations.

Digital Death and Spectacular Death,"Throughout human history, individuals, communities and societies have always had to confront and tackle the problem of death. Consequently, death remains a topic of social scientific relevance, highlighting the need for its study and for theorising around it. This article analyses the development of the social scientific study of death and dying, taking inspiration from Philippe Ariès’s historical stages to discuss the recent developments in the field, namely the study of digital death. The article begins with a discussion of the visibility of death in modern society in the context of spectacular death. The analysis emphasises its four dimensions: mediatisation, commercialisation, re-ritualisation and the revolution in end-of-life care. The article moves on to discuss the emergence of digital death as the current stage and reflects on its similarities to spectacular death and its transformation of public imaginaries around death in contemporary society. The article concludes with a reflection on future developments in the field, specifically the emergence and study of artificial intelligence (AI) in digitalised death culture.

"From the Initial Celebration to the Current Disappointment, the Evolution of the Internet beyond Determinisms","In the first phase, the eruption of the Internet was embraced by academics who saw it as a way of involving young people in politics who had suffered from disaffection and rejection. They emphasized its emancipatory, horizontal, and participatory qualities. Decades later, a wave of disenchantment, apathy, and rejection of platforms has swept through the academy. The previous generation of technological determinists, who welcomed it with open arms, left the arena to their counterparts: the ones that claimed that we had no chance of participation and perpetuated industrial age exploitation. In this article, we will present the two opposite visions, but first, we will briefly review the Internet’s beginnings, its motivations, and its technical characteristics in order to better understand the two antagonistic positions.

"Beyond the Shadow of Adults—Youth, Adultism, and Human Rights in the Contemporary Faroe Islands","This article discusses young people’s human rights situation in the Faroe Islands today by addressing youth participation issues from a cultural adultism perspective. It argues that the local cultural values and intergenerational relations in the family influence the multilayered and shifting nature of ‘Faroese adultism’. My purpose is to explore the ways through which young people are challenging adultism in their everyday life practices: what do they intend to change and what do they wish to sustain in their cultural struggle? This article is mainly based on empirical data from focus group discussions with young participants. The findings reveal that young people from the Faroe Islands—located in the Nordic Atlantic—do not consider adultism to have a negative impact on their wellbeing. This article, relying on theoretical scholarship and ideas from youth studies and island studies, contributes to a more nuanced understanding of human rights in the context of a small (family-oriented) island community in cultural and social transformation.

Communication about Purchase Desires between Children and Their Parents in Croatia,"The main aim of this study is to describe the communication between children and parents about children’s desired purchases of items in Croatia. Online focus groups were conducted with children ages 11 to 15, and their parents, using a pre-prepared list of questions. The constant comparative method was applied, and the data were coded thematically, meaning data were organized into groups or codes on the basis of repeating keywords in the transcripts. The analysis shows children mostly ask their parents for clothing items and food. The findings indicate children and parents resolve the purchase decisions based on a few communication themes. Children employ persuasion, bargaining, and negotiation communication to acquire their desired items. As a response, parents employ bargaining and negotiation communication, budgeting and financial communication, usefulness and need communication, and postponed purchase communication. This research contributes to a better understanding of child and parent communication related to child purchase wishes and parent–child communication.

Evaluation of Gender-Related Digital Violence Training in Catalonia,"This study examines the results of evaluating a Catalan training program for practitioners working with survivors of gender-related violence. Considering the lack of scientific evidence previously shown by studies on this topic, this article aimed to triangulate the participants’ self-perception with their assessment of knowledge and competencies in tackling digital gender-related violence before and after the training. To do so, a pre-test and post-test case-based design was employed to identify and measure the participants’ improvement in self-perceived knowledge and their effective gain in knowledge and skills to address this kind of violence. Considering the contributions of a feminist evaluation approach, we also included in our evaluation the analysis of classroom interactions and the participants’ responses. The results overall demonstrate that the incorporation of assessment criteria from the feminist evaluation methodology increased the reliability of evaluation criteria. In addition, it also enabled us to identify the need to continue developing training programs that empower participants and prevent women and LGBTQI+ people from disengaging from digital spaces.

“Will I Be Celebrated at the End of This Training?” Inclusive Research in Kenya,"The development and practice of inclusive research with people with intellectual disabilities is complex, revealing challenges and lessons that inform innovative and novel methodological approaches. In Africa, inclusive research still lags for various reasons. First, due to societal misconceptions that portray people with intellectual disabilities as unable to self-advocate or as lacking agency and self-determination; second, due to a lack of trained researchers and ethics committees on inclusive research practices. This paper critically reflects on and discusses the strategies and methods used to conduct an inclusive research study in Kenya. The focus was on the methodological approach of including people with intellectual disabilities as researchers in Kenya. Two people with intellectual disabilities were trained as research assistants. This paper describes the experiences with Institutional Review Boards, the processes and experiences while training this research assistants using a UK-developed curriculum, and fieldwork experiences while piloting interview guides, conducting interviews, and conducting focus groups with this research assistants. This study findings indicate the need to culturally adapt co-researcher training, the importance of working with support personnel who empower researchers with intellectual disabilities, and the need for greater advocacy to change negative attitudes towards people with intellectual disabilities that hinder their participation in research.

Semantic Networks of Election Fraud: Comparing the Twitter Discourses of the U.S. and Korean Presidential Elections,"Traditional news outlets, such as newspapers and television, are no longer major sources of news. These media channels have been replaced by social platforms, which have increased in value as information distributors. This change in communication is an underlying reason for the election fraud controversies that occurred in the United States and South Korea, which hold high standards of democracy, during similar periods. This study investigates a model for sharing political disputes over social networks, especially Twitter, and illustrates the influence of political polarization. This study examines Twitter content around the presidential elections in the United States and South Korea in 2020 and 2022, respectively. It applies semantic network analysis and structural topic modeling to describe and compare the dynamics of online discourse on the issue of election fraud. The results show that online spaces such as Twitter serve as public spheres for discussion among active political participants. Social networks are key settings for forming and spreading election fraud controversies in the United States and South Korea, with differences in content. In addition, the study applies large-volume text data and new analytical methods such as the structural topic model to examine the in-depth relationships among political issues in cyberspace.

Case Study on Spatial Mismatch between Multivariate and Student-Teacher Rate in U.S. Public School Districts,"An important aspect of educational equity is the balance between students and teachers in the general education system. To address the need for a sustainable, balanced, and reliable supply of high-quality STEM teachers for public school districts, this research aims to illustrate the spatial dynamics of student-teacher balance in the impact of teacher salary, school poverty, transportation, and environmental factors from 2015 to 2020, Data were collected to create a multivariate evaluation via Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP), Compromise Programming (CP), weight linear combination and Spatial Mismatch Index Model (SMI) to reveal the non-synergistic coupling relationship between multivariate and student-teacher rate in school districts, counties, and state multiple levels. The results suggest that compared to 10% of the spatial mismatch index at the state level, the proportion of mismatched areas at the school district and county levels was the same at 1%. NV, IN, VT, MA, and FL were mismatched at the state level but had good matches at the county and school district levels. Other unpredictable factors related to teacher shortages, such as workload, school rankings, and teacher vacancies, should be considered for further study in future research plans. This research provides valuable insights for policy interventions to improve the treatment of teachers in public school districts and promote educational equity.

Occupational Gender Segregation and Mental Health among Professionals: Women’s Risk Exposure in Five Micro Classes,"This study explores the intricate interplay between gender, occupation, and mental health using data from the 2020 EU-LFS ad hoc module on 38,066 female professionals in Western Europe. We examine their exposure to work-related risks impacting mental health, focusing on variables such as work overload, violence, and challenging client interactions. Our primary objective is to discern how various occupations contribute to distinct experiences of work-induced strains. Key findings challenge the compensating differential theory, according to which the lower wages in female-dominated occupations are compensated by more friendly working conditions, revealing that interactive service-sector jobs pose higher risks to mental well-being. Health professionals, legal-cultural professionals, and teachers are particularly susceptible, with shift and weekend work exacerbating risk exposure to violence and violent behaviors. This study underscores the significance of a “within-gender” perspective, uncovering nuanced occupation-based inequalities for women. It introduces a novel approach to occupational segregation, highlighting the uneven distribution of work-induced strains among different occupations. It also urges to reassess customer-worker relationships and proposes gender-specific measures to alleviate heightened risks to mental well-being for interactive service occupations. In conclusion, this study analyzes the intersection of gender, occupation, and work-induced strains, emphasizing the role of micro-classes in shaping women’s mental health.

Understanding the Mobilities of Indigenous Migrant Youth across the Americas,"Enhanced immigration enforcement measures are now a dominant practice throughout the world. The concept of transnationalism, used by scholars to illuminate the complex dynamics these measures have across nation-state borders, has been critiqued for its replication of methodological nationalism—the assumption that the nation-state is a natural social and political form of the modern world. How then can migration scholars deepen the understanding of the mobilities of migrant children and youth without replicating methodological nationalism? We propose a relational socio-cultural analytic that synthesizes settler colonial theory and the theory of racialized legal status to comprehend the complex experiences of Indigenous migrant Maya youth and families throughout the Americas. Our use of a relational critical comparative analysis challenges structural functionalist approaches that limit the study migration dynamics within nation-state contexts, which can unwittingly sustain national membership in a state(s) as an aspirational emblem of belonging. We explore how Indigenous Maya experience and challenge the meaning of statelessness and the spillover effects of immigration enforcement measures along the US–Mexico and Mexico–Guatemala borders. We argue that a relational socio-cultural analytic lens serves as a powerful tool for understanding how nation-states co-produce stateless Indigenous populations and how these populations persist throughout the Americas and the world.

"A Qualitative Exploration of the Influence of Climate Change on Migration of Women in the Riverine Area of Bayelsa State, Nigeria","The riverine region of Bayelsa State, Nigeria, faces a critical issue as the impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disruptions to traditional livelihoods, disproportionately affect women. This qualitative study aimed to fill a gap in understanding by exploring the nuanced ways in which these environmental challenges influence the migration decisions of women who have fled floods, remain displaced, and have opted not to return to prevent potential negative experiences linked to future flooding in the region. The research delves into the interplay between climate change, gender dynamics, and community resilience. Employing an exploratory research design with purposive and snowball sampling techniques, the study selected 51 female participants. Through 24 in-depth interviews and three focus group discussions, the research captured the nuanced experiences of women grappling with the challenges posed by climate change. Thematic analysis was applied to analyze the collected data. The study unveiled that climate change significantly shapes the migration decisions of women in the riverine area of Bayelsa State. This influence manifests through disrupted livelihoods, flooding, water scarcity, diseases and health challenges, housing insecurity, increased environmental vulnerabilities, and uncertain future prospects. These findings underscore the pressing need for gender-responsive policies and community-based strategies to address the complex interplay between climate change impacts and women’s migration experiences.

Chilean Disaster Response and Alternative Measures for Improvement,"Effective DRM aims to identify and minimize both hazards and vulnerabilities of a territory. This case study carried out in Chile analyzes national programs and disaster risk management structures at different administrative levels (national, regional, and municipal) and identifies gaps that contribute to the vulnerability of the current system. The proposed measures and options for improvement presented in this study are based on a literature review of scientific discussions about international governance, disaster risk management, and case studies conducted in Chile. The results indicate that the national disaster risk management plan has been adjusted in recent years, especially after the 2010 Chilean earthquake. The national administration, which is primarily responsible for managing potential risks, as well as the regional and local governments, has been replaced by the National Disaster Prevention and Response System (SINAPRED) in 2021, according to the 21364 law. This law was created to make cities more resilient, contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This change is intended to decentralize disaster risk management, considering local conditions and preventing oversight of disaster risk management, which is not mandatory at the local level. It has also noted some gaps, such as the lack of standardization of emergency and early warning systems and funding at local levels. It is hoped that the system will move forward in this transition period and that the gaps will not affect effective risk management, as they have caused loss of life in past disasters.

From a neighbourhood-based approach, this article addresses the integration trajectories of Sri Lankan entrepreneurs in Rione Sanità, Naples, which is a socio-economically deprived neighbourhood hosting a substantial segment of foreign populations and has been the target of significant urban regeneration initiatives over the past decade. Sri Lankans established travel agencies, fiscal assistance centres, restaurants, takeaways, and retailers in a transformative context. This article highlights how entrepreneurial initiatives are shaped by the mutual connection linking immigrants with the place where they found economic and relational opportunities. The results serve as a crucial starting point for better understanding the long-term outcomes of the socio-economic integration at the neighbourhood level.

The Effect of Generation Z’s Understanding of Free Will and Fatalism on Their Political Choice: A Field Study,"The aim of this study is to determine whether the fatalistic tendencies of young adult university students predict their political preferences. For this purpose, the fatalism tendency scale consisting of four sub-dimensions was applied, and the predictive power of the obtained data on political preferences was examined. The study sample consisted of 630 young adult university students (male 294, female 336) between the ages of 18 and 26. Independent variables are fatalism sub-dimensions (predetermination, personal control, luck, and superstition), and dependent variables are political leaders and political party preferences. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to determine the effect of independent variables on dependent variables. The analysis results revealed that the sub-dimensions of fatalism, predetermination, luck, and superstition significantly predicted voters’ preferences for political leaders. No significant relationship could be detected between the change in participants’ personal control tendency and their preference for political leaders. In the second stage of the analysis, it was examined whether the tendency towards fatalism affected the choice of political party. It was observed that the sub-dimensions of predetermination, luck, and superstition were significant predictors of political party preferences. There was no significant relationship between change in personal control tendency and political party preference. The research results revealed that if the tendency towards fatalism changes, there are also significant changes in political preferences.

"Beware, Not Everyone Lies the Same Way! Investigating the Effects of Interviewees’ Profiles and Lie Content on Verbal Cues","Research shows that lying is a common behaviour, and that verbal cues can be effective for lie detection. However, deception detection is not straightforward as there are several factors at play, such as interpersonal differences and the content of the lie. Consequently, the effectiveness of available cues for deception detection can vary significantly. In a pre-registered study involving 80 participants (a priori sample size analyses were conducted), we instructed participants to either tell the truth or lie about an autobiographical event and an opinion. The participants also completed questionnaires on personality traits and cognitive tasks, resulting in two participant clusters. Surprisingly, when analysing verbal behaviour, truthfulness, cluster memberships, and their interactions were not found to be significant. Only lie content affected verbal cues. Additional, non-pre-registered analyses revealed that liars displayed more micro-expressions than truth tellers, but only when describing their memories and when focusing on the latency time between the investigator’s question and the interviewee’s answer. The results were interpreted in terms of the experimental design, which encouraged only short answers from the interviewees, leaving limited room for verbal content to be effective.

Exploring the Immortological Imagination: Advocating for a Sociology of Immortality,"The digital age has rekindled popular and academic interest in immortality. While the idea of immortality has long been recognized as fundamental to human societies, unlike death, within the field of sociology, immortality has not yet established itself as a distinct and autonomous field of study. This paper contributes to the recently emerging scholarship promoting a sociology of immortality. Drawing inspiration from C. Wright Mills’s sociological imagination (1959) and building upon significant research in the field of immortality, we offer to use the concept of the immortological imagination as an analytical and conceptual tool for further developing a sociology of immortality. We refer to the immortological imagination as a complementary concept to Penfold-Mounce’s thanatological imagination, seeing both concepts as stemming from two different lineages and academic traditions. After defining the immortological imagination and how it differs from and complements the thanatological imagination, the paper moves to discuss examples in popular culture establishing the potential impacts and influences of the immortological imagination, particularly within the digital context.

"Law Programs, Ethno–Racial Relations Education, and Confronting Racism in the Brazilian Judiciary","This article focuses on the lack of full compliance with teaching ethno–racial relations education in Brazilian university undergraduate programs, particularly law programs. Teaching this topic was specified by the Conselho Nacional de Educação (CNE, National Education Council) in Resolution CNE/CP no. 01/2004. Although teaching ethno–racial relations education has not been a panacea for judicial sentencing based on racial criteria, we propose the working hypothesis that teaching it is a tool that can help catalyze a reduction in racist sentences by courts, for example, a defendant not fitting the stereotypical criminal pattern by being white or being assumed to belong to some criminal group for being black (preto) or brown (pardo). Through surveys at sixty-nine federal universities and documentary research into law program curricula, it was discovered that Resolution CNE/CP no. 01/2004 is not being fully or appropriately implemented at these institutions, a fact that may be enabling the continuance of race-based penal sentencing, which is illegal and extremely harmful to the black/brown Brazilian population. To prevent or minimize this problem, full compliance with Resolution CNE/CP no. 01/2004 is suggested.

Reconsidering Recognition in the Lives of Children and Young People in Care: Insights from the Mockingbird Family in South Australia,"This study explored the experiences of children and young people in the Mockingbird Family, South Australia, during implementation and roll-out. The study involved semi-structured interviews with a diverse group of 54 participants, including 21 children and young people, 12 foster carers, and 14 agency workers. Thematic analysis, with the application of Axel Honneth’s recognition theory, showed the Mockingbird Family model to validate the emotional, cognitive, and social support needs of children and young people. Through interconnected experience, the nurturing of care and the promotion of rights-based, holistic approaches were crucial for achieving social recognition, dignity, and developmental growth. The study indicates the potential benefits of the Mockingbird Family model for addressing the needs of children and young people in care. The research suggests that a community-based support model such as the Mockingbird Family should be considered in child welfare practices. However, further research is necessary to fully understand the model’s long-term effects and justify its integration into wider child welfare policies.

Emotivism Trends in Digital Political Communication: The Influence on the Results of the US Presidential Elections,"Citizens, organizations and institutions are increasingly making use of digital social networks such as Twitter as a means by which to express their position as regards political topics. However, an increasing amount of academic literature coincides, in that it highlights the emotive and expressive nature of these positions. In other words, for the most part, the political opinions that are publicized are more like backing based on support or rejection (without arguments or motives). In parallel, said expressions have a key emotional element (expressions of a positive or negative affective disposition). This article consists of an analysis that aims, on the one hand, to measure the affective disposition of US citizens as expressed on Twitter during the two most recent electoral campaigns (2016 and 2020). Similarly, we have generated a model that facilitates the measurement of the extent to which the content of the aforementioned messages demonstrates arguments or motives, or lack of. By way of the use of a database for the same Twitter accounts in both elections, we provide very consistent results that highlight the lack of argumentation of the public debate and the notably polarized profile of the affective dispositions shown by participants. We use the thesis of emotivism to give a more significant analytical weighting to this research.

"Preventative Strategies to Curb School Violence: A Case Study of Selected Schools in Hhohho District of Eswatini, Mbabane","The violence occurring in schools is a concerning phenomenon with pervasive implications for learners, teachers, and communities. Its impact culminates in fear, stress, and a reduced sense of safety among learners and teachers. Its consequences extend beyond physical harm, thus affecting an individual’s mental well-being. This study provides a precis of the comprehensive nature of school violence and preventative strategies meant to curb this phenomenon. This study employed a case study design located within the interpretative paradigm. A qualitative approach was used to delve into the perceptions of learners and educators on the nature of school violence and measures that could be adopted to prevent it. Thirty (n = 30) participants involving ten learners (n = 10), ten parents (n = 10), and ten educators (n = 10) were purposively sampled. Ten learners participated in focus-group discussions, with five learners representing each school located in Mbabane, Eswatini (Imbabane Central and Mater Dolorosa High Schools). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 teachers and 10 parents (5 parents and 5 teachers from each school). A lack of effective methods of disciplining learners was identified as a cause of bullying and aggressive behaviours among learners. The findings reflect that violence is deeply rooted in harmful social norms, with corporal punishment being widely advocated by the participants. The findings indicate a crucial need for adopting an integrated and collaborative approach to the development and implementation of effective preventative measures.

Digital Communication Studies during the Pandemic: A Sociological Review Using Topic Modeling Strategy,"The health crisis triggered by COVID-19 has exerted a profound influence on both conventional communication methods and the manifestations of interaction within the virtual sphere. Gradually, studies on digital communication have taken on an increasingly prominent role in various social science disciplines that address determinants such as the crisis of misinformation or digital interaction in contemporary societies. This study aims to analyze the key research topics that sociology has addressed in relation to the pandemic, along with the level of innovation in the utilization of digital sources and analytical methodology. The analysis is grounded in the hypothesis that the effects of the pandemic have led the discipline of sociology to reassess and more fully integrate studies on digital communication. On this premise, a systematic review of studies sourced from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases was executed. Innovative computational methodologies were employed for the categorization of articles and the elucidation of principal research topics. Furthermore, this research scrutinized the principal digital platforms utilized in these investigations and assessed the extent of methodological innovation applied to data analysis. The outcomes unveiled a pronounced ascendancy in the prominence of communication studies during the pandemic. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the utilization of digital data sources in research remains surprisingly limited. This observation highlights a potential avenue for further exploration within the domain of sociological research, promising a more profound and contemporaneous comprehension of social phenomena amid times of crisis.

Interrogative Suggestibility and Ability to Give Resistant Responses in Children with Mild Intellectual Disabilities and Borderline Intellectual Functioning,"Children with intellectual disabilities can be victims of crimes but are generally deemed less reliable in the forensic context than children without disabilities. Their deficits may cause inaccurate recall, greater memory errors, and greater suggestive vulnerability. The aim of the present study is to verify the effects of intellectual abilities on recall tasks, levels of suggestibility, vulnerability to negative social pressure, and Resistant Behavioural Responses (RBR). The study involved 120 children aged 7–16 years who were administered the GSS2 (1997) and Raven Matrices. Forty children had a diagnosis of mild intellectual disability (MID), 40 had borderline intellectual functioning (BIF), and 40 were typically developing peers. Children with MID and BIF showed more errors in distortions, inventions, and confabulations at the recall task and higher levels of suggestibility.Low IQs reduced the ability of source monitoring and led to less resistant responses to misleading questions. IQ affected resistant responses both at the first and second suggestive interview, reducing both source monitoring capabilities and the ability to manage social pressure. Age may impact the ability to provide resistant responses but only in the first suggestive interview (Yield 1), which depends more on the maturity of cognitive processes involved in interrogative suggestibility.

"Examining Loneliness: A Comparative Analysis of Face-to-Face, Telephone, and Online Communication among Japanese Young Adults","(1) Background: Loneliness is inherently linked to social connections, with interpersonal communication playing a pivotal role. Despite this connection, limited research exists on the relationship between loneliness and communication among young adults. This study investigates the correlation between face-to-face, telephone, and online communication frequencies and loneliness among individuals in their 20s. (2) Methods: Using a dataset from a nationwide survey conducted by the Japanese Cabinet Office, this study focuses on 1812 respondents aged 20–30, selected from a random sample of 20,000 individuals aged 16 and older across Japan. (3) Results: A Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis reveals a significant association between communication frequency and loneliness, even after adjusting for demographic characteristics. Notably, decreased communication frequency across all modalities correlated with increased loneliness. Online communication exhibited the highest impact, followed by face-to-face communication, with phone call communication ranking last. (4) Conclusions: This study emphasizes the importance of seamlessly integrating social networking service (SNS)-based communication with various forms of social interaction. A well-balanced integration of these approaches is crucial for mitigating loneliness among young individuals and promoting positive mental health outcomes.

"Empowering Undergraduate Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine: Exploring Experiences, Fostering Motivation, and Advancing Gender Equity","The representation and success of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) have sparked discussions, given their underrepresentation in these traditionally male-dominated fields. While women comprise 40% of STEMM undergraduates, senior-level positions see this figure drop below 20%. Research suggests that gender disparities in STEMM participation result from motivational differences, rather than competence. Exploring the reasons for these disparities are important as they can have significant consequences for the acknowledgement of women in STEMM, the maintenance of their STEMM discipline, and future careers. As such, this study explored how the experiences of 13 female undergraduates in Australian STEMM programs impacted their motivation and persistence in their degree. Through face-to-face semi-structured interviews, analysed via reflexive thematic analysis, five themes were constructed, encapsulating diverse experiences shaping female undergraduates in STEMM, influencing self-efficacy, determination, and well-being. Early exposure and environment were pivotal, acting as motivators or deterrents. Additionally, peer support was suggested as being crucial, fostering belongingness in the male-dominated space. Participants also grappled with recognition challenges, influenced by gender imbalances and a lack of role models. Intimidation was evident, leading to thoughts of dropping out, but passion drove persistence amid these challenges. The research increases awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by female undergraduates in STEMM, offering valuable insights for developing strategies to enhance their university experiences and promote success in future STEMM careers.

Examining External and Internal Acculturative Factors: Cuban-Born Women’s Experience of Well-Being in the U.S.,"Objective: This study investigates the influence of acculturative stress on the mental well-being of Cuban-born women and Latina immigrants, emphasizing their distinctive experiences. Methods: Utilizing data from the National Latino Asian American Study (NLAAS), a comprehensive nationwide mental health investigation among Latino and Asian Americans, this study examined 264 Cuban women (average age: 58) who migrated to the United States and live in south Florida. The study employed Family Stress Management (FSM) framework and Bekteshi et al.’s Contextual Influence on Acculturative Stress (CIAS) framework to scrutinize the interplay of contextual factors and individual characteristics impacting adolescents’ psychological distress. Results: The findings revealed several noteworthy associations. Higher levels of church attendance, challenges in visiting family overseas, and perceived racial discrimination correlated with elevated stress levels. Furthermore, the age at which individuals immigrated was positively linked to increased stress (b = 0.18; p = 0.04), indicating that older Cuban immigrants experienced greater psychological distress upon their arrival in the United States. Additionally, higher levels of conflict between family and cultural values, as well as intensified religious beliefs, were associated with elevated distress levels. Conclusion: This study underscores the intricate interplay of diverse contextual factors in shaping the mental health and well-being of Cuban-born women. The insights derived from this research have implications for the development of tailored interventions and support systems, aiming to address the unique needs of this population.

Fear and Distress: How Can We Measure the Impact of Technology-Facilitated Abuse in Relationships?,"Technology-facilitated abuse in relationships (TAR) is a relatively new form of intimate partner violence. Research exploring the impact of TAR on young people is limited, and while robust measures of TAR itself are emerging, measures of TAR impact lack evidence of validity. A mixed-methods approach was used to establish preliminary face and content validity for the measurement of TAR impact. Youth discussion groups (n = 38) revealed that (1) distress is favored over upset as a preferred measure of TAR impact, and (2) fear is an appropriate impact measure for some TAR behaviors. In an online survey, frontline practitioners (n = 171) perceived and subsequently rated a total of 54 TAR behaviors in the upper half of the severity range on fear and distress, with 6 behaviors ranking among each of the top 10 most fear- and distress-inducing behaviors. These findings provide evidence of both face and content validity for the use of fear and distress measures when seeking to understand the impact of TAR. Scholars, practitioners, and educators alike can use this evidence to enhance the validity of investigations into TAR and its impact, to support victims of TAR, and to improve TAR education among youth.

Effects of Parental Workplace Discrimination on Sickness Presenteeism,"This paper analyzes the association between experienced and observed parental workplace discrimination and sickness presenteeism. Following stress theoretical approaches and reactance theory, we expected that both experienced and observed parental discrimination of others at the workplace would lead to a reactance behavior and could increase sickness presenteeism, especially in those individuals who deny arguments of justification. Based on survey data from employees aged between 20 and 45 years (n = 347), we confirmed experienced discrimination as a double risk factor that goes along with increased sickness, as well as an increased sickness presence propensity. Although observed discrimination against others was unrelated to sickness, it was similarly associated with increased presenteeism. For respondents with their own children, the association between experienced discrimination and presenteeism was amplified in those who disagree with economic justifications of discrimination. The relationship between presenteeism and observed discrimination in childless respondents was amplified in those who appraise discrimination as unfair. In accordance with a stress theoretical approach, we confirm negative health effects of parental discrimination. In accordance with reactance theory, it is concluded that discrimination encourages workers’ presenteeism in the sense of a self-endangering behavior to counter inappropriate stereotypes held against them.

Investigating the Effect of Social Media on Dependency and Communication Practices in Emirati Society,"In the evolving landscape of information dissemination, the importance of social media has become crucial. This is especially apparent in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, where we observed social media integration into different parts of daily life, yielding myriad impacts. The present study investigates the effects of social media on the communication dependency of Emirati individuals who engage with these platforms, further leading to communication with friends, family, and professional connections in the post-pandemic era. Based on the media dependency theory, this research gathered data from 385 respondents that were further analyzed by using Partial Least Square-Structural Equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results showed that Emirati users widely rely on social media for communication and interactivity. It is further found that social media use is significantly linked to communication with friends and families among the study respondents. Finally, the use of social media for professional communication also remained significantly related, indicating social media as a potential source of communication among Emiratis in the post-pandemic era. Thus, the broader agreement remained towards the role of social media as an agent to sustain socialization even after the disease outbreak. It is concluded that as we progress, both individuals and organizations must adopt the potential benefits of these platforms while also effectively managing the challenges they bring. Improving digital literacy and adaptability will be crucial for effectively navigating this growing communication environment.

"Institutional Trust, Spirituality, and Religious Practice in the United States","This study explores the relationship between institutional trust and elements of religion in contemporary American society. Using a nationally representative survey, we utilize latent class and regression analyses to assess the contours of these relationships. Our findings reveal a diverse institutional trust profile, with pronounced distrust in democratic institutions, especially Congress, although the group with low institutional trust is the smallest one within the society. While trust in religious institutions, and to an extent broader institutional trust, predict religiosity, this is less so with the case of spirituality. Institutional trust similarly shows modest positive relationships to public religious practice, while a clear negative relationship to private religious practice. Interpreting these findings through the lens of secularization and privatization of religion, we hope to provide a strong empirical contribution to the literature regarding intersections of institutional trust and the evolving religious and spiritual orientations of today’s American landscape.

The Right to Be a Subject of Your Own Life—A Study of Parent-Teacher Conferences in Danish Lower Secondary Education,"Many recent legislative reforms concerning children have emphasized the importance of involving children and adolescents in accordance with the principles of Article 12 in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. This article deals with the rights of youths to express their opinions, feelings, and views in parent-teacher conferences in lower secondary education in Denmark. Both international and Danish research on parent-teacher conferences has shown that students are often objectified and are not provided with real opportunities to participate with their own voices and perspectives. Based on the sociology of Hartmut Rosa, the article explores students’ experiences of parent-teacher conferences as zones of alienation or spaces of resonance. In addition, we draw on Gert Biesta’s concept of subjectification to analyze how the current organization of the conferences largely displaces students’ opportunities to bring themselves into play as subjects of their own lives. The analysis is based on observations and interviews carried out in 2021 and 2022.

Monitoring of Norwegian Foster Homes,"Based on interviews, this article explores how the monitoring of foster homes is experienced by children and youths who have been exposed to what they consider abusive behaviour by foster parents. Using a thematic narrative theoretical framework, the article shows that a common narrative in the youths’ accounts is a story of mistrust towards social workers and monitoring officers, which relates to a general mistrust towards the child welfare service. The young individuals are reluctant to tell monitoring officers about how they truly experience their situation in their foster home. At the same time, some of the youths have difficulty comprehending what normal parenting behaviour is like, due to previous experiences of neglect from adults. The article discusses how successful monitoring of foster homes largely stands or falls on the children’s and youths’ ability to disclose their experiences to their supervisors and monitoring officers. We argue that the youths’ narratives tell a story of disempowerment. This represents a dilemma in the monitoring of Norwegian foster homes and in the children’s right to protection.

The Role of Self-Control in Cyberbullying Bystander Behavior,"The present study examined the association between general low self-control (LSC) and its three subcomponents: risk taking, self-centeredness, and impulsivity and various bystander behaviors of cyberbullying. The study utilized a bifactor modeling approach and included a sample of 501 adolescents aged 14–18 years old. Participants’ behaviors were measured using a self-reported questionnaire. General LSC was positively associated with the cyberbully-supporters’ and passive bystanders’ behaviors. Additionally, risk taking was positively associated with both the victim-defender’s and cyberbully-supporter’s behaviors, while self-centeredness was positively associated with both the passive bystander’s and the cyberbully-supporter’s behaviors. Furthermore, impulsivity was positively associated with the cyberbully-supporter’s behaviors. We conclude that general LSC plays an important role in understanding the cyberbully-supporter’s and passive bystander’s behaviors in cyberspace. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that LSC subcomponents were also associated with the bystanders’ behaviors above and beyond the associations between general LSC and these types of behaviors.

“I Just Want to Live My Life”: Young Disabled People’s Possibilities for Achieving Participation and Wellness,"This study aimed to (a) explore disabled children’s and adolescents’ possibilities for participation and (b) identify the practices and policies that affect their participation and how these are enacted. Case studies were conducted with seven children and adolescents with various impairments. Each case included interviews with the young person, their parents and teachers, as well as observations in their usual environments. The interview topics covered the young people’s participation, their sense of belonging and aspects that were pivotal to their engagement and wellness. The observations focused on their possibilities for participation and interactions with peers and adults. These young disabled people’s possibilities for participation at home, in school and in their neighbourhoods were affected by complex dynamics between personal and environmental factors. Whether and how the young people’s disability-related rights were enacted depended on the socio-cultural–material arrangements and parents’ knowledge of the welfare system. To better understand and act on the complex and marginalised position of young disabled people, more focus should be directed at policies that affect their rights and possibilities for participation and how these are enacted in practice. Knowledge needs to be expanded to scrutinise the disabling hindrances hidden in social and structural spaces and implemented in services.

To Be Scared or Not to Be Scared: Social Representations of COVID-19 in Young People (A Cross-Cultural Study),"The COVID-19 pandemic is a serious global threat to the world’s population. The aim of the presented exploratory study was to reveal and analyse social thinking about COVID-19 in two different cultural contexts: Russia and Malaysia. Social representation (SR) theory is a promising framework to analyse the symbolic response to the global health emergency. This exploratory study was conducted at the time of new COVID-19 variants’ emergence, accompanied by quarantine measures, and mass vaccination was not elaborated yet (12 October–15 December 2020). The total sample (convenience sampling) consisted of 349 young adults from Malaysia (n = 195, 35.4% males, 64.6% females) and Russia (n = 154, 10% males, 90% females) aged 17–36 years. Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants, and an online version of the questionnaire was proposed to participants. The free association technique was used as the main tool in order to reveal the content of SRs. This prototypical analysis allowed us to reveal a hypothetical structure of SRs in the two cultural groups. These SR structures in each sample were crystallised around mostly negative elements. While in the Malaysian sample, the key elements were troubling and disturbing (death, pandemic, virus, quarantine), in the Russian sample (quarantine, disease), these elements could be seen as a rationalisation (or even a denial) of the COVID-19 threat.

Education and Other Factors Influencing Women Migrants’ Employability and Entrepreneurship,"Education is considered to be one of the most critical factors when it comes to finding work or starting a business. However, for women migrants, other factors can have an even more decisive influence, since they are starting out with the double disadvantage they face as women and migrants. This manuscript sets out to identify and analyse the individual and external factors that affect the employability and entrepreneurship of women migrants. To do this, we conducted a systematised qualitative review of recent literature. The studies analysed address different aspects of integration and employment but agree on many of the factors that hinder employability and entrepreneurship, such as traditional gender mandates, racism, socioeconomic status, the migration process, age or human capital. However, the scientific literature continues to mask the reality of women migrants who face discrimination or inequalities derived, for example, from their belonging to the LGBTQ+ collective or their functional diversity.

Tackling Gender-Related Violence: How Can Theory Inform International Professional Education Projects?,"Is it helpful to share feminist theory with youth practitioners and is there room for it on short training courses such as in EU Action Projects? Can theoretical work on intersectionality, and the concept of gender-related violence (GRV) which grew from it, be shared in training interventions with professionals who work with children and young people? This article is based on the findings of the EU co-funded GAP Work Project that sought to improve GRV intervention and referral through training for practitioners in everyday (rather than specialist) contact with children or young people in four countries. Summarising how the project worked, and how theory informed it, including a brief account of how the concept of GRV worked in practice, guides the selection of material from the wider Project Final Report and offers a reflection on how educators used theory in the training, sometimes explicitly in the sessions. It therefore contributes our experiences to discussions about the design and implementation of education and training about violence and abuse. It concludes by sharing resources for designing and implementing training on sexual harassment, violence and hate crime, including from other recent projects that offer resources for incorporating an intersectional perspective when developing local government plans, programmes, and projects.

Towards a Co-Creative Immersive Digital Storytelling Methodology to Explore Experiences of Homelessness in Loughborough,"Despite the potential use of digital storytelling with marginalised groups, there are few examples of its application in homelessness or examinations of co-creative relationships in this context. Along with digital storytelling, this research used immersive media (virtual reality and 360 degree video) to explore place-based social exclusion. In the feasibility study, with four doctoral researchers at Loughborough University as participants, immersive digital stories were co-created. The aim of this study was to understand how to create place-based immersive digital stories, through adapting existing digital storytelling methods and the co-creation of virtual reality, to inform best practices for future studies involving participants who have experienced homelessness. Participants created maps and empathy timelines, shared stories, recorded voiceovers and edited footage. The researcher facilitated this and recorded the 360-degree filmed footage. The final stories proved to explore place-based social exclusion. Co-creative relationships were found to be more significant between the researcher and individual participant than amongst the participants as a group. With immersive media, the researcher’s experience formed an active part of the finished pieces. Despite this, participants described their role as director, being ultimately in control. These findings will influence the methods that will be used in the future with those who have experienced homelessness in Loughborough. They also show how immersive media in digital storytelling can strengthen co-creation and acknowledge the researcher in the story.

Housework Reallocation between Genders and Generations during China’s COVID-19 Lockdowns: Patterns & Reasons,"This paper examines housework reallocation during China’s stringent pandemic lockdowns in 2020, where individuals were homebound and job-free while employment status remained unchanged. Utilizing a mixed-method approach, it analyzes 1669 surveys and 100 interviews to understand changes in domestic labor patterns and the underlying reasons. The findings indicate that men increased their participation in grocery shopping but decreased in cooking, cleaning, and laundry during the lockdown. This gender-task pattern was mirrored in multi-generational households, where younger family members often took on these tasks. The reasons articulated for these shifts predominantly converged around the ‘doing gender’ theory. Women, particularly those working full-time, had more time to engage in household chores. Men, while also having more available time, predominantly focused on grocery shopping, a task that gained masculine connotations during the lockdown. Factors such as perceived differences in household labor quality, difficulty delegating housework, and reduced workload led to women’s increased involvement and specialization in domestic tasks. The study challenges the notion that economic factors are the primary drivers of gender-based division of housework. Instead, it suggests that ingrained gender norms continue to dictate domestic roles, as evidenced during the lockdown period devoid of usual economic and time pressures.

Getúlio Vargas and the Making of Restrictive Migratory Policies in Post-1930 Brazil,"Following Brazil’s “great migration” period (1880–1930) came Getúlio Vargas’s rise to power, marking a radical historical rupture. From 1930 onwards, we observed the construction of a framework of restrictive rules aimed at controlling the entry and stay of foreigners in the country, including an ethnically differentiated management of flows. This article sought to cross-reference the new migratory policy, aimed at both new entries and immigrants already present in the territory, with the issue of race. To this end, it dealt with two groups of immigrants whose flows were directly impacted by the new policies (and by racism), but not in the same way: Japanese and Jews. The reflection also turned to the different experiences in each of the two groups between the candidates for immigration—in the face of the new barriers imposed on entry and those already living in Brazil in the face of the assimilationist measures adopted. Brazilian migration policies and state actions have been studied more often than the agency of immigrants. In this sense, the existing studies have focused more on the management of new flows than on the experience of immigrants already settled in the territory. The text, therefore, assumed a change of perspective, opting for a look “from below” in order to focus on both sides of the scales and the border. Finally, it examined the historiography that dealt with migration policy during the Vargas era and, more specifically, that which focused on Jewish and Japanese immigration.

Human Resource Management Practices and Decent Work in UN Global Compact: A Qualitative Analysis of Participants’ Reports,"This study aims at describing and characterizing the Human Resources practices (HRPs), as reported by organizations within the framework of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). That endeavor was undertaken considering the concept of decent work (DW). Specifically, we intended to analyze and verify to what extent those practices translate and incorporate the concept of DW to build a typology of commitment levels by organizations regarding the values behind UNGC. We conducted a documentary analysis on 40 annual reports of Portuguese organizations’ participants of the UNGC. A qualitative content analysis using NVivo and a descriptive and cluster analysis based on coding similarity were performed. One output of this research is the design of a maturity typology of adhesion to the UNCG. Four levels were identified, reflecting expressed concerns with DW concepts and the UNGC Ten Principles and its integration into HRP. This research reflects the concerns of Human Resources Management (HRM) with the wellbeing, development, and conditions of employees and may support the design of future research and interventions, leading to more responsible and ethical HRM practices.

The Background Factors and Reality of Domestic Abuse Faced by High-Income Women: An Online Survey in Japan,"This study aimed to examine the prevalence and factors influencing domestic abuse victimization among high-income women in Japan, including physical, psychological, economic, and sexual abuse. The background factors and reality of domestic abuse faced by high-income women have not been sufficiently addressed, although some academic studies contend that economically disadvantaged women are more susceptible to domestic abuse. This study collected data from 359 high-income women in Japan using an online questionnaire survey. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the contributing factors. Approximately one-fifth of high-income women had suffered physical, economic, and sexual domestic abuse, and approximately two-fifths had experienced psychological violence. Adverse childhood experiences, the degree of approval of traditional gender norms, quarrels over opposing views on traditional gender norms, and partners’ education levels considerably influenced the prevalence of domestic abuse among high-income female victims. In contrast with the literature, the earnings gap between female victims and their partners did not yield meaningful results. This study examines the experiences of four types of domestic abuse among high-income women in East Asia and highlights the factors that contribute to it, as exemplified by Japan, which is a research direction that has not received sufficient attention. It also offers valuable insight into domestic abuse support policies that target low-income women in contemporary society.

"Epistemic Uncertainty, Social Dominance Orientation, and Prejudices toward Women in Leadership Roles: Mediation and Moderation Analyses","This research investigated the relation between the need for cognitive closure, social dominance orientation, and attitudes toward women as managers within a sample of Italian workers (N = 391) enrolled in a cross-sectional study. More specifically, we hypothesized and found that the association between need for cognitive closure and prejudice toward women managers was mediated by social dominance orientation. Notably, these results remained significant even after controlling for participants’ gender, education, age, and political orientation. Further, results from a moderation analysis revealed that the relationship between social dominance orientation and negative attitudes toward woman leaders was moderated by the need for cognitive closure. That is, the relationship between social dominance orientation and prejudice towards women managers was stronger for participants higher in need for cognitive closure—compared to those who were low. These results could shed light on new routes in practical intervention aimed at solving prejudice towards women in leadership roles.

Endless Exile—Alain Resnais’s The War Is Over,"This paper aims to analyze the movie The War Is Over (La guerre est finie—France/Sweden, 1966, directed by Alain Resnais and a screenplay by Jorge Semprún). The idea is to point out a possible sociological discussion on exile, mobilizing the notion of mental images. The methodological approach is an internal analysis of the film to allow for the elaboration of sociological considerations along with the expressive elements of the film construction. To do so, we shall focus on the “leaps” within the movie’s narrative order, in which a main character (Diego) anticipates, through imagination, a series of sequences and events that might or might not have occurred. To discuss the notion of mental images and their relationship with the imaginary, the theoretical reference will be Cornelius Castoriadis’ book The Imaginary Institution of Society. This article will benefit from the discussions in the presentations about the film both at meetings in Brazil and at the last ISA Congress 2023 (International Sociological Association—Research Committee 37—Sociology of Arts). This text is one of the results of research supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP).

The TEI Program for Peer Tutoring and the Prevention of Bullying: Its Influence on Social Skills and Empathy among Secondary School Students,"Bullying is a phenomenon that afflicts millions of students around the world, severely harming their emotional and psychological well-being. In response to this challenge, the TEI program (Tutoría Entre Iguales or Peer Tutoring) has been developed as a bullying prevention strategy, aiding students in acquiring social skills and emotional strategies for conflict resolution. The purpose of this research is to examine social skills and empathy among different actors involved in bullying (non-involved, victim, bully, and bully-victim) among secondary school students and to evaluate the impact of the TEI program on the development of relational competencies. A comparative, ex post facto study was conducted in three schools where the TEI program has been implemented (TEI schools) and three where it has not (non-TEI schools). A total of 738 secondary school students (ESO) participated in the study, using a standardized questionnaire to evaluate their perception of bullying. The results of this study demonstrate higher levels of assertiveness and empathy in the non-involved and victim groups. However, lower levels of conflict resolution skills were found in the bully-victim group. In TEI schools, a higher percentage of students not involved in bullying and a lower percentage of bully-victims were observed. Additionally, students in TEI schools scored higher in assertiveness, conflict resolution skills, social skills, and empathy. These findings highlight the importance of developing students’ relational competencies and implementing strategies for bullying prevention to create a safe, healthy, and positive learning environment in schools.

Energy and Environmental Challenges in the European Union and Green Bonds,"Could the European Union mitigate the negative effects of economic, pandemic and environmental crises using only one tool? The answer is positive, by implementing “green” fiscal expansion financed by “green” common debt, such as issuing green bonds. In this paper, we connect the independent responses to different crises into a single response that could end them. The European Union’s theoretical background is based on new-classical models, but current research findings doubt new-classical orthodoxy, underling the importance of economic federalism for sustainable economic and green growth. We argue that the Economic and Monetary Union has to speed up fiscal federalism by establishing a powerful European Union common budget using green Eurobonds and implementing fiscal transfers as a mechanism to address the consequences of the triple crisis.

"Intensification of Hate Speech, Based on the Conversation Generated on TikTok during the Escalation of the War in the Middle East in 2023","The present research has been carried out concurrently with the conversation that took place on the social network TikTok during the most recent escalation of the war between Hamas and Israel in the Middle East (Gaza-Palestine) during the month of October 2023. The main objective of this article is to analyze of how young audiences are informed about complex problems, the quality of that information, and the consequences of the intensification of uncontrolled hate speech. Regarding the methodology, data were extracted from TikTok using the open-source tool tiktok-hashtag-analysis—hosted on GitHub—which facilitated the analysis of hashtags within the posts collected from this social network, starting with an initial sample of 17,654 comments. The article draws and reaches conclusions related to the fact that young audiences indeed are interested in the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East, as it is evident that the conversation—which is polarized—on TikTok about this issue has escalated considerably. Similarly, analysis of the extracted and filtered sample shows that the variable “hate speech” intensified on the platform during the analyzed conversation.

Justice in Achievement Matters: The Fairness of Educational Opportunities and Active Citizenship,"Unlike existing research which has focused mainly on the effects of educational attainment and curricula on active citizenship, the present article aims to study the relationship of subjective assessment regarding the fairness of people’s educational opportunities and their active social engagement, and how this relationship is embedded in different social environments. Theoretically, the analysis is based on the view of active citizenship as a multidimensional and domain-specific phenomenon. It is also inspired by the capability approach’s understanding of the opportunity aspect of freedom and the importance of fairness of opportunities and processes. Empirically, our study uses a multilevel linear regression model to analyse data from the European Social Survey 2018 for 29 countries. We develop a scale of active citizenship with four domains: political, social, workplace, and democratic values. Our findings show that a higher perceived unfairness of educational opportunities is associated with lower levels of active citizenship. They also reveal that although there is a negative relationship between the perceived unfairness of people’s opportunities to receive a desired level of education and their active citizenship, it is mitigated when people are living in high-trust societies and in countries which are more economically and democratically developed.

Peer Support Provided by People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities: A Rapid Scoping Review to Develop a Toolkit for Inclusive Research,"Inclusive research teams actively engage people with intellectual and developmental disabilities at all stages of research development, implementation, and dissemination. There is a dearth of research that specifically addresses the use of peer support in research engagement, yet research using peer support may provide a useful framework for engagement in inclusive research teams. A rapid scoping review was completed following the reporting guidelines for PRISMA-SCR. The scoping review identified five peer support roles (communication, sharing experiences, helping peers to learn, peer development, and creating a welcoming environment) and two types of support and accommodation for peer supporters (individual and environmental). The findings of the rapid scoping review aided in developing key sections of a Peer Support Toolkit to help people with intellectual and developmental disabilities engage in research to create more inclusive research teams and research that is informed directly by the needs of people with lived experience. The scoping review and toolkit were completed by an inclusive team.

Adversarial Growth among Refugees: A Scoping Review,"Background: The main aims of this scoping review are to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing knowledge about adversarial growth among refugees, and to gain insight into the complexity of post-trauma development. Methods: We applied a systematic search strategy resulting in the inclusion of 43 quantitative and qualitative empirical studies. Our findings underscore the prevalence of growth as a common phenomenon among refugees, emphasizing the positive associations with problem-focused coping, optimism, positive reappraisal, religiosity, and social support. Additionally, this review sheds light on the qualitative experiences and outcomes of growth, particularly pro-social outcomes, and the cultural and religious aspects of growth processes. Findings concerning the role of time and post-migration factors on growth processes highlight the need for more studies among established refugees. In sum, the findings supplement and lend nuance to pathology-oriented research, while acknowledging the severity of suffering and trauma and their consequences for individuals. We suggest that further research should focus on existential aspects and theories of growth: compassion, altruism, and pro-sociality following trauma, and the importance of religious and cultural elements in growth processes.

After Being Granted or Refused Asylum in Norway: Relational Migration Journeys among Afghan Unaccompanied Young Men,"This article considers experiences of moving and dwelling in Europe among Afghan unaccompanied young men in the context of stringent migration, asylum, and settlement processes. The young men embarked as minors and arrived unaccompanied in Norway. There, their claims for asylum had radically different outcomes: some were granted international protection and others were refused asylum. The article sheds light on forms of relationality on migration journeys by focusing on relational selves and subjectivities regarding trajectories, processes of inclusion and exclusion, and family. Participants shared numerous challenges and struggles arising from their journeys, but also possibilities and transformations taking place alongside developmental changes and life transitions. While some attached meaning to experienced hardships and drew on a sense of direction, others spoke of exhaustion or inoculated themselves from an inability to pursue a direction they desired and saw as necessary for their lives. They made sense of their experiences relationally, relating to hopes and fears, idealised and longed for kinship ties and care, and the ongoing processes and positionings involved in shaping their present situations and imaginings of the future.

"Social Media, Newsworthiness, and Missing White Woman Syndrome: A Criminological Analysis","Missing White Woman Syndrome has been widely acknowledged within traditional mainstream media, resulting in a heavy focus on missing white women and a simultaneous underrepresentation of missing women from minority ethnic communities. However, less is known about whether this has carried through to social media, wherein users play a key role in determining what becomes widespread news. This review seeks to examine this issue with reference to existing research. It begins by exploring the concept of newsworthiness and the ways in which social media influences the distribution of news. It will then review the concept of the ‘ideal victim’, and its continued association with ethnicity. Finally, the review will examine Missing White Woman Syndrome and the ways in which it has historically manifested within traditional media and continues to manifest on social media. The review will conclude with a discussion on findings and avenues for future research in Ireland and internationally.

"Narratives of Symbolic Objects: Exploring Relational Wellbeing of Young Refugees Living in Scotland, Finland, and Norway","Background: In this study, objects are used as a representation of relational wellbeing to help young refugees living in Norway, Scotland, and Finland to talk about important persons who make them feel well. At the time of this research, there is no known study that uses objects to facilitate narratives of how young refugees and members of their social networks generate relational wellbeing. Methods: Using a qualitative approach, young refugees participated in individual interviews about the objects they brought to art workshops to understand their experiences, feelings, and acts of wellbeing. Results: Treating each object as unique to the owner was powerful in revealing how relational wellbeing is experienced and expressed. There were overlaps in experiences and expressions of wellbeing, hence our themes of discussion: overlaps between old and new social ties; between time and space; and between the three constructs of relational wellbeing. Old ties were not forgotten; instead, they evolved to a different form, supporting young refugees from a distance, while new ties contributed to what is needed in their present and at their current age. Experiences of relational wellbeing transcended time and space between their disrupted places of origin, their experiences on the journey, and settling in their new countries. The constructs of relational wellbeing—feeling good, being connected, and having enough—were inseparable in the participants’ experiences. Conclusions: We conclude that these overlaps have implications for a relational wellbeing approach in theory and practice. The results leave a challenge for both researchers and practitioners to develop complex research and intervention methods that can capture these tapestries of young refugees’ experiences of relational wellbeing.

Our data consist of 73 mothers’ responses to a qualitative survey conducted between 18 April and 26 May 2020. In our analysis, we employ the division of well-being into three dimensions: having, loving, and being. According to our results, the participating mothers experienced dramatic changes, such as an increased burden of care and domestic work, difficulties helping children with remote studies, health concerns, a lack of free time, isolation from Finnish society and the inability to travel to their country of origin. Family-centered activities helped the mothers to cope in this situation but also caused strains. Based on our findings, we discuss the vulnerabilities these mothers experienced in relation to language, migration background and gender roles.

The Role of Subjective Well-Being in Cuban Civil Protest against the Government: A Moderated Mediation Model,"This empirical study sought to understand the drivers behind civil protest participation in authoritarian contexts, explicitly focusing on Cuba. The data were sourced from 658 respondents via online surveys facilitated by CubaData, an independent social research agency specializing in Cuban studies, employing a secure panel system that guarantees the confidentiality and anonymity of participants. Our research primarily investigated the role of satisfaction with government policies in terms of the intention to participate in civil protests, introducing subjective well-being as a moderating variable. Utilizing the Process module of SMART-PLS 4 to emulate Process Model 58 for moderated mediation analysis, we accounted for measurement errors to ensure robust findings. Further controls were incorporated for age and political self-efficacy. The results revealed that subjective well-being significantly moderates the link between satisfaction with government policies and actual participation in civil protests. These findings suggest that the happiness level can change resistance dynamics within authoritarian settings. This research has implications for academic understandings of political behavior in autocratic regimes and practical applications in policy making and activism in Cuba.

Suggesting Context Differences Influence the Impact of Nurses’ Psychological Contracts,"Inconsistent findings regarding psychological contracts may be due to the variety of contexts studied. Sensemaking processes inform the psychological contract and may explain contextual differences. This study examines the psychological contract components of promises, fulfillment and breach, with negative affectivity, in relation to employee-level outcomes in two related but different contexts. Surveys were completed by 162 hospital nurses and 218 aged care nurses, in a situation where many potential contextual moderators were held relatively constant. Both fulfillment and breach were significant and predicted multiple outcomes in each context. Similar patterns of results for fulfillment and breach suggests there may simultaneously be two forms of discrepancy mechanism underpinning the impacts of the psychological contract: assessment of continuous discrepancy (fulfillment) and assessment of discontinuous discrepancy (breach). Negative affectivity appears to have prevented relationships, particularly between breach and stress, and should be included in future psychological contract research. The consistent relationships of fulfillment and breach with organizational and occupational commitment highlights the importance of career management. The main differences by context were the negative effects of breach and the lack of an effect for promises for aged care nurses, possibly due to prestige and other differences to be investigated in future research.

‘Whose Place of Speech?’ Brazil’s Afro- and Queer-Centric YouTube Channels and the Decentralization of TV Globo’s Telenovela Discourse,"For several decades, Brazil’s Grupo Globo, which controls radio, TV, and newspaper, served as the hegemonic voice controlling the audio, visual, and narrative dimensions of social phenomena that formed and informed social, political, and cultural attitudes among Brazilians. Of all their divisions, none has been more influential than the TV Globo network. Lately, with the popularization of free access to digital media, such as those offered by YouTube, TV Globo’s viewership has substantially declined. This paper discusses the concept of controlling images to analyze examples of TV Globo’s constructed visual image of the hypersexualized Afro-Brazilian female body in the network’s soap operas. It also analyzes cases of TV Globo’s constructed narrative over another subaltern Brazilian group: the LGBTQIA+ community. Recently, Afro-Brazilian and Queer-centric YouTube channels have attracted subscribers by emphasizing content centered on negritude, gender politics, and place of speech while deconstructing and de-normalizing Eurocentric and patriarchal controlling images. Against examples of TV Globo’s normative discourse of the past decades, the YouTube channels discussed in this paper represent alternative mediums for agency, visibility, and unbiased representations of gender and racial identities in Brazil.

Food Insecurity within a Public University and the Role of Food Assistance Programs Amid the Global Pandemic,"Food insecurity (FI) is a pressing concern among university students in the United States, and the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this issue. Providing food assistance for university students has become more challenging due to pandemic-related consequences and interventions. This study aims to (1) analyze social inequalities in FI among university students in a large public university during the pandemic, (2) investigate the association of their utilization of campus, community, and federal food assistance programs (FAPs) and FI, and (3) understand the barriers students face in accessing FAPs. Survey questionnaires were distributed to students to gather their socio-demographics, FI, and usage of FAPs. Logistic regression was utilized to assess the relationship between students’ FI and their use of FAPs. Among the surveyed students (n = 282), 33.7% reported experiencing FI. Higher FI rates were observed among socially vulnerable student groups, for example, non-Hispanic Black (62.5%) and Hispanic students (38.7%), compared with non-Hispanic White students (32.1%). FAPs had a limited influence on students’ FI due to low utilization. The primary barriers to FAPs were insufficient information, ineligibility, and social stigma. The findings suggest it is crucial to reduce barriers to using FAPs and develop targeted interventions for marginalized students to address inequalities in FI.

Expanding Possibilities for Inclusive Research: Learning from People with Profound Intellectual and Multiple Disabilities and Decolonising Research,"This paper pursues the argument that finding a way for people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities to belong in inclusive research requires starting from a deep knowledge of the people in question. This paper illustrates this idea in action showing what can be possible from building research around ‘being with’ people with profound intellectual disabilities, creating intersubjective knowledge together. It follows the journey of fostering a relational research space that a young person with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities can occupy, their assenting to share the space and ensuing exploring together in embodied ways. Small stories show where this particular open road of inclusive research can lead. The analysis interacts with provocations from decolonising research that demand respect for wider ways of knowing, doing research and being human. The paper invites reflection on the ways in which research needs to be deconstructed to be inclusive for all.

The Shifting Stress of Working Parents: An Examination of Dual Pandemic Disruptions—Remote Work and Remote Schooling,"Working remotely at least some of the time has long been seen as promoting a better integration of work and care obligations, even though prepandemic research is mixed as to the extent to which parents benefit emotionally from remote work. We exploit dual social experiments in schooling and work spawned by the COVID-19 pandemic to understand any stress-reducing effects of working from home under different school-closing state policy contexts. The pandemic led to an unprecedented shift to (and subsequent away from) remote and hybrid work but also to the implementation of various containment policies, most notably school closures driving a shift to remote learning that were put into effect to different degrees across U.S. states. Drawing on parents’ data from a U.S. nationally representative panel survey of workers who spent at least some time working from home since the pandemic onset, we use mixed-effects models to examine whether and in what ways cross-state and over-time variations in school closure policies shape any stress-reducing impacts of remote/hybrid work. Results show that when schools were not mandated to close, remote/hybrid work largely reduces parents’—especially mothers’—stress. However, an opposite pattern emerges in the face of closing mandates. These patterns are especially pronounced among white mothers and are not observed among nonparents.

Moving for Love: Interracial Marriage and Migration in Brazil,"The link between marriage and migration is usually considered in terms of international migration. However, domestic migration provides another lens in which to view this connection. In Brazil, despite the large migration from the northeast to the southern regions in the twentieth century, the role of domestic migration in race-mixing has been unacknowledged. Since race in Brazil is highly regionalized, with black and brown Brazilians comprising most northern regions and white Brazilians being in the majority of the southern areas of the country, migration can open possibilities for interracial marriage that are less likely to occur for non-migrants. At the same time, as gender plays an important role in opportunities for intermarriage, the effects of migration likely vary according to intersections of race and gender. An examination of the data on marital unions from the 2009 Brazilian National Household Survey, which includes large numbers of earlier cohorts of mass migration, demonstrates the influence of migration on interracial marriage. This study finds that the effect of migration on the odds of being interracially married (in comparison with being in a same-race marital union) vary according to the race and gender of the spouse. This study is one of the first to tie together two demographic phenomena—migration and interracial marriage—that have not previously been examined in the Brazilian context. It also provides a new lens through which to understand interracial marriage in Brazil and has implications for future studies of family formation in Latin America and the Caribbean.

"The Body, the Spirit, and the Other: Yantras as Embodied Cultural Integration","This article looks at the Sak Yant tattoo style, which is becoming increasingly popular among so-called “Westerners”. It explores the questions of whether Sak Yant tattoos among “Westerners” will typically fall under copyright issues and cultural appropriation, and what makes Sak Yants relevant to clients. Underlying this research, with a marketing analysis of Sak Yants on Instagram, is the assumption that marketing is also guided by (anticipated) customer desires and can thus tell us something about their perspective. Two interrelated aspects become apparent: Sak Yants integrate aesthetics and spirituality as well as the body and mind, entities that are often considered separately in the “West”, which may be appealing to the “Western” customer and which sets Sak Yants apart from other tattoo styles. The meanings that Sak Yants have usually go deeper than just to the surface, as is not only illustrated by the process and permanence of tattooing but also by the importance of the ritual. People from the respective cultural contexts usually benefit and take part in the process. Therefore, instead of cultural appropriation or appreciation, one could perhaps speak of cultural participation or integration.

Hate-Speech Countering by Immigrant and Pro-Immigrant Associations in Almeria (Spain),"In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in anti-immigrant hate speech on social media. Drawing on interviews with 15 immigrant associations and 11 pro-immigrant associations in the southern Spanish province of Almería, as well as digital ethnography, this article explores strategies used by immigrant and pro-immigrant associations to counter hate speech. The rise of this hate speech, disseminated mainly by far-right parties, has occurred at a time when many immigrant associations have little or no access to social media platforms. However, members of all these associations (immigrant and pro-immigrant) are aware of the perverse effects of these discourses, as they have either received them on their personal social media platforms or experienced abhorrent hate-speech attacks against their members and/or users. Despite their difficulties in navigating the “glocaline political arena”, they have participated in a number of projects and developed tools that allow them to generate a counter-discourse. We identify and explore the richness and diversity of these online campaigns and activities, highlighting the difficulties that immigrant associations—compared to pro-immigrant ones—face in navigating the glocaline political arena.

How Countries Compete for Success in Elite Sport: A Systematic Review,"The ‘Global Sporting Arms Race’ is the term that describes the competition among different countries to succeed in international sports competitions. The development of that peaceful competition determines two outputs: an increase in soft power at the international level and a promotion of the national identity and social impact. It means increasing the level of influence that the countries obtain internationally as a cornerstone of the concept of a sporting nation with a proud and healthy population. In order to explain the factors involved in the success of a sports system at the elite level, a systematic review was carried out based on the PRISMA protocol in the databases Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. The findings of the study show that the factors that determine success at the international level have received increased attention, as shown by the number of publications since 2010. The results indicate the following research factors: (1) it was observed that most researchers tend to carry out comprehensive analyses with a holistic perspective, while the UK, Australia, Canada, and Spain carry out segmented analyses; (2) Olympic sports—especially athletics—were the most analysed; while in non-Olympic sports, those with social influence predominate in countries, such as netball; (3) the analysis of meso and micro factors is preferred over macro factors; (4) quantitative studies are preferred through the analysis of primary sources, such as official reports; and (5) the economic variable is the most common input, with medals reached at the elite level being the most used output to check the correlation or significativity of the results.

Re-Conceptualizing Insider/Outsider Positionalities in Migration Research as ‘Liquid Positionalities’: An Analytical Tool for Migration Scholars,"Dominant theoretical discussions on insider/outsider, co-ethnic/co-national migrant researcher positionalities have focused on the ideas of group identities such as nationality and ethnicity and how they shape and inform insider/outsider researchers’ positionalities. While some migration researchers argue that shared nationality and ethnicity make co-national or co-ethnic researchers insiders, others contend that the insiderness/outsiderness of co-national or co-ethnic researchers tends to be shaped and informed by multiple, fluid and changing situational factors. This paper draws on ‘fluid identity theory’ and secondary literature to argue that in migration research, insider/outsider positionalities tend to be fluid formations that change, shift and become unstable during research encounters with study participants. I develop an analytical concept that I term ‘liquid insider/outsider positionalities’ to contribute to the literature on insider/outsider researcher positionalities in migration research. By way of introducing this analytical concept, I critique presuppositions, conceptualizations and categorizations of migrant/migration researchers as either insiders or outsiders based on predetermined and rigid social identity markers such as ethnicity or nationality. Migration scholars and researchers may employ the concept of ‘liquid insider/outsider positionalities’ as a tool to frame the dynamic, changing and situational character of researcher positionalities in migration research during field research encounters.

One’s Heaven Can Be Another’s Hell: A Mixed Analysis of Portuguese Nationalist Fanpages,"This paper analyzes the processes of racialization in Portuguese right-wing political movements through two prominent nationalist fanpages. It employs a mixed-methods approach that includes both quantitative and qualitative official data. The sample covers 72 months, from January 2017 to December 2020, encompassing a total of 3670 posts on Facebook. The main findings reveal that the fanpages utilize different discursive strategies, sometimes focusing on publishing static images and other times on sharing news links. From these publications, the fanpages garnered more than 1.4 million interactions, demonstrating consistent growth in their follower bases over the years. Emotional responses played a significant role in the interactions, particularly with Love, Sad, and Angry reactions standing out. The results also reveal that Portuguese nationalism maintains a dual ideology concerning race: ethno-exclusivism and ethno-pluralism. This observation affirms the dual nature of nationalist fanpages, where narrative elements converge and diverge based on the intended goal. Thus, individuals from Africa and Afro-descendants can be portrayed as both national heroes and social scum.

“The Will to Survive”: The Lives of Young People with “No Papers” in the United Kingdom,"This article considers how undocumented youth in the UK survive and construct their everyday lives in precarious circumstances. Drawing on multiple in-depth narrative interviews with (n = 7) undocumented youth, I illustrate how these young people focus on the future and engage in purposeful activities as a way of enduring the everyday challenges of living with no papers. I reflect on the relationships, which young people draw on to enable them to endure adversity and rebuild their everyday lives. I conclude that the presence of love and community is critical for young people’s survival, safety and wellbeing, and I suggest how practitioners and researchers might make use of these findings.

Dilemmas Related to Young Children’s Participation and Rights: A Discourse Analysis Study of Present and Future Professionals Working with Children,"According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), every child has the right to be heard and express their views in matters that concern them. Yet, participation is one of the most debated aspects of the UNCRC. Although children’s participation is a statutory requirement of Finnish early childhood education and care (ECEC) and schools, educators are often unfamiliar with how to meet the demands of participation. In this study, we examined what kinds of counter discourses about the realization of children’s participation could be differentiated in interviews with present and future education professionals who took part in a study program focusing on knowledge and skills regarding young children’s rights and participation. The data, which consisted of individual and group interviews with 31 participants, were analyzed with discourse analysis. Three counter discourses were identified: unrealized, adult-defined, and elusive participation. The discourses illuminated various dilemmas in children’s participation. Awareness of such dilemmas enables the development of pedagogical practices that enhance children’s wellbeing and rights.

"“It’s a Phenomenon in Our Community, a Phenomenon That Is Silenced”: Child Sexual Abuse and the Circles of Silence in the Jewish National Religious Community in Israel","This study focused on Jewish national religious educators in Israel by exploring their narratives surrounding coping with the CSA of their students, including the perceived silencing of the phenomena within the community and the desire to provide their students with the care they require. In-depth interviews were conducted with 34 national religious educators, including teachers (n = 20), counselors (n = 4), and principals (n = 10), which were analyzed using a thematic approach. Three themes emerged in the findings: (1) a community in silence surrounding CSA, (2) the role of sex education in bridging between silence and CSA, and (3) educators’ experiences of breaking the silence by making their voices heard. The findings revealed that the participants experienced three circles of silencing surrounding CSA: silencing of their experience within their community, silencing of their students, and self-silencing. These circles affected the educators both personally and professionally. This study discusses how these circles of silence received three justifications: familial, religious, and personal. This study highlights the important role of Jewish national religious educators in identifying and leading interventions in CSA cases and the need for reflective, socio-religious, culturally based training alongside support for the educators to maintain their wellbeing when addressing CSA.

Education-to-Work Transitions in Former Communist Countries after 30-Plus Years of Transformation,"This paper reviews how young people’s education-to-work transitions have changed since 1989 in former communist countries that have subsequently become full members of the European Union (EU). The sudden collapse of the command economies led to an equally abrupt breakdown in earlier routes into working life. Subsequently, the new independent states have reconstructed their education and training, and their market economies have developed. They now exhibit similar variations in rates of youth unemployment, progression through higher education, and mixtures of academic and vocational secondary education as older EU member states. However, there are features that continue to set all ex-communist countries apart, irrespective of whether they have become full EU members. These are low local rates of pay and westward migration. Its new member states have joined the Southern countries in a European periphery. Yet, there may be sufficient winners in the European core and periphery to keep Europe united.

Prejudice towards Immigrants: A Conceptual and Theoretical Overview on Its Social Psychological Determinants,"Immigration processes and the possible marginalization of ethnic minorities in the receiving countries are essential issues in contemporary societies. Prejudice and discrimination can be critical obstacles to immigrants’ integration into the host country and can severely affect their well-being and mental health. This theoretical and conceptual overview aims to highlight the critical social–psychological processes underlying attitudes toward immigrants. First, it tackles the social psychological roots of social prejudice by focusing on the role of individual (ideological, motivational, and cultural) factors and categorization processes. Second, it examines how contextual factors such as intergroup perceptions and structural relations can lead to high levels of prejudice and discrimination towards immigrants. This review highlights how prejudice against immigrants can be driven by various factors at the individual and contextual level, suggesting that programs aimed at facilitating harmonious relations in contemporary multi-ethnic societies should consider such different determinants. Accordingly, the conclusion discusses possible interventions that can promote better relations between the majority and immigrant groups and counteract the negative impact of discrimination.

Towards Quality Education: An Entrepreneurship Education Program for the Improvement of Self-Efficacy and Personal Initiative of Adolescents,"In recent decades, youth unemployment has been the focus of attention of international and community bodies in the area of social rights. Specifically, there is a need to promote attitudes and skills to access employment, decent work, and entrepreneurship. The measures implemented have not been effective. In 2023, Spain had the highest youth unemployment rate in the European Union (29.6%). An improvement in the level and quality of education and training of young people would reduce their level of unemployment. Entrepreneurship education is, therefore, a necessary value in the society of the 21st century since it is a tool for the development and growth of the younger population. In the entrepreneurship education model proposed in this study for adolescents, we focus on the capacities of self-efficacy and personal initiative as precursors of entrepreneurial behavior. This paper analyzes the differences between the mean values of the variables before and after the implementation of the educational program and the influence or correlation between the variables. The main results are threefold: (i) the educational program implemented improves the mean values of the two variables analyzed; (ii) self-efficacy exerts a positive or direct influence on personal initiative, and (iii) the educational program improves or reinforces the positive influence of self-efficacy on personal initiative.

Commodification in Urban Planning: Exploring the Habitus of Practitioners in a Neoliberal Context,"The concept of habitus, as introduced by Pierre Bourdieu, serves as a lens to understand the subjective dispositions and perceptions that influence decision-making within the social realm. This study delves into the intricate relationship between urban planners’ habitus and the commodification processes inherent in a neoliberal society. Through thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 27 Chilean urban planners, this research identifies typologies that capture their disciplinary stances on three pivotal urbanism facets: the city’s conceptualization, the nuances of urban practice, and visions of utopia. A salient finding is the palpable tension urban planners experience, torn between the aspiration to foster a well-conceived city and the commodifying forces that shape decision-making. This commodification of the planner’s ethos emerges as a byproduct of entrenched neoliberal institutional practices. This study delineates three distinct habitus typologies: the public, private, and academic urban planner, each exhibiting varied perspectives on the commodification of urban planning. Collectively, these insights shed light on the profound ways in which neoliberal paradigms influence urban planning, revealing both its disciplinary boundaries and inherent contradictions.

Validation of the General Evaluation Scale for Measuring Ethnic and Religious Prejudice in an Indonesian Sample,"The General Evaluation Scale (GES) has been widely employed to assess attitudes toward outgroups, including ethnic and religious prejudice. However, validation within the Indonesian context has not been conducted. Using two studies (Study 1, religious prejudice; Study 2, ethnic prejudice), we provide evidence of psychometric properties of a six-item GES for measuring ethnic and religious prejudice based on factor structure, composite reliability, and convergent validity in Indonesia. The results demonstrate an acceptable model fit for a single-factor structure characterized by high internal consistency (McDonald’s Omega/ω = 0.93 in Study 1, ω = 0.94 in Study 2). Furthermore, the scale exhibits solid convergent validity, as evidenced by its correlations with the blatant and subtle prejudice scale (r = −0.44 in Study 1, r = −0.74 in Study 2) and the feeling thermometer scale (r = 0.60 in Study 1, r = 0.78 in Study 2). In summary, this research unequivocally establishes the GES as a valuable instrument for measuring religious and ethnic prejudice in the Indonesian context, underpinned by its robust psychometric properties. Nevertheless, it underscores the need for further investigations with diverse samples and varying social contexts to bolster the scale’s reliability and applicability.

Connecting Us Back to Ourselves: Aesthetic Experience as a Means to Growth after Trauma,"This article examines the experience and effects of a trauma-responsive program that uses creative methods to address the ongoing psychosocial impacts of transgenerational trauma and youth suicide, which disproportionately affect First Nations people in Australia. Our aim is to understand how the aesthetic (sensory-affective) dimensions of such a program serve to promote experiences of growth after trauma, manifesting in a sense of connection to both self and community. The paper focuses on the second of two immersive, experiential workshops delivered seven months apart in the regional town of Warwick in Queensland, Australia. In the light of self-reports of growth and personal transformation following the initial workshop, the paper examines the key drivers of such growth, focusing in particular on how trauma-related experience is metabolised through cultural containment. It builds on Bion’s concept of container/contained, combining analysis of the affordances of immersion. Framed in cultural rather than medical terms, the larger goal of the paper is to establish how cultural programs fill a gap in trauma informed support, facilitating the processing of trauma.

Do Segmented Assimilation Theory and Racialized Place Inequality Framework Help Explain Differences in Deaths Due to COVID-19 Observed among Hispanic Subgroups in New York City?,"This article studies the differences in the correlation between deaths and the Hispanic share for different Hispanic subgroups in New York City. Such differences are predicted by Segmented Assimilation Theory as different assimilation paths. The study is carried out at the level of PUMAs, and it is argued that such geographic locations are macro-level factors that determine health outcomes, as the theory of Racialized Place Inequality Framework claims. The study presents a spatially correlated model that allows to decompose the spatial effects into direct and indirect effects. Direct effects are linked to the macro structure where the individual lives, while indirect effects refer to effects in the adjacent macro structures where the individual lives. The results show that both types of effects are significant. The importance of the direct effects is predicted by RPIF, while the importance of the indirect effects is a new result that shows the complexity of the effects of macro structures. The article also shows results for subsamples that allow to test the importance of different factors that have been linked to the excess deaths observed among Hispanics. The effects of such factors are also found to be heterogenous among the different Hispanic subgroups, which also provides evidence in favor of the Segmented Assimilation Theory. Access to health insurance and doctor density are found to be the most important elements that serve as protective factors for all Hispanic subgroups in New York City, signaling its importance in achieving assimilation for Hispanic immigrants to New York City.

"Stigma and Mental Well-Being among Teenage Mothers in the Rural Areas of Makhado, Limpopo Province","Adolescent mothers experience psychological challenges, such as social withdrawal and rejection by their communities. Assuming the role of motherhood is associated with emotional and mental distress, such as fear and worry, regret and frustration, guilt and shame, and social isolation. This study adopted a qualitative critical participatory action research approach. Purposive and snowballing recruitment were employed to recruit 11 teenage mothers, and semi-structured face-to-face interviews and focus group discussions were employed to generate data. All sessions were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis. Teenage mothers in this study reported experiencing humiliation and being subjected to degrading remarks and judgement by schoolmates. The experience of being rejected, teased, and labelled made participants feel that they were not accepted as part of their community. It was concluded that teenage mothers experienced inconsistent support from parents and community members, which led to social isolation and feeling rejected; hence, teenage mothers lacked a sense of belonging to and acceptance by their communities. Policymakers and authorities in education and healthcare should encourage social change and transformative learning and address the issue of stigma and social isolation experienced by teenage mothers in rural communities.

Mentoring and Monitoring of Student Teachers in Their In-School Placements—The Case of the University of Santiago de Compostela,"(1) The in-school placement is a key scenario in linking theory and practice in the processes of initial teacher education (ITE) and constitutes a crucial element in the understanding of professional competencies and the experimentation of educational innovation proposals. For this reason, the pedagogical model that guides teaching practices and the set of learning activities that university and school mentors develop is especially relevant. This paper aims to analyze the current individualized monitoring processes of student teachers, as well as to detect difficulties and needs for improvement. (2) The center of interest corresponds to the internship mentors of the ITE degrees of the Faculty of Education Sciences at the University of Santiago de Compostela. This research was carried out through a descriptive study with a survey method and a study sample of 202 mentors. (3) Results show that there are discrepancies in the activities that university and school mentors implement with students, as well as in the observation and supervision processes. (4) We propose a learning reflective methodology based on the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model to coordinate agents involved in the internship, connecting them through a specialized eLearning environment equipped with specific tools to facilitate the processes of individualized monitoring, reflective learning, and self-regulation.

"“It’s like We’re Still in Slavery”: Stress as Distress and Discourse among Jamaican Farm Workers in Ontario, Canada","For more than fifty years, Jamaican farm workers have been seasonally employed in Canada under the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program (SAWP). In Canada, these workers live and work in conditions that make them vulnerable to various health issues, including poor mental health. This ethnographic study investigated Jamaican SAWP workers’ mental health experiences in Southern Ontario. Several common factors that engender psychological distress among Jamaican workers, ranging from mild to extreme suffering, were uncovered and organised into five themes: (1) family, (2) work environments and SAWP relations, (3) living conditions and isolation, (4) racism and social exclusion, and (5) illness and injury. I found that Jamaican workers predominantly use the term ‘stress’ to articulate distress, and they associate experiences of suffering with historic plantation slavery. Analysis of workers’ stress discourses revealed their experiences of psychological distress are structured by the conditions of the SAWP and their social marginalisation in Ontario. This article presents and discusses these findings in the context of SAWP power dynamics and concludes with policy recommendations aimed at improving the mental health of all SAWP workers. In foregrounding the experiences of Jamaican workers, this study addresses the dearth of research on the health and wellbeing of Caribbean SAWP workers.

A Longitudinal Investigation of a Partial SMEC in a Sample of University Students,"A part of the Simple Model of Environmental Citizenship (SMEC) was explored in a two-wave longitudinal study in a non-intervention setting with approximately one month between measurements. The variables of environmental citizenship, environmental literacy, concrete environmental knowledge, and environmental (self-)education were chosen as potentially the most malleable parts of the SMEC which could naturally change over time in an educational setting. A total of 171 university students participated in the first measurement wave of the study, and 93 participants were retained in the second wave. The mean age of participants was 23 years of age (SD = 4), and 76.6% of participants were women, 21.6% were men, and 1.8% chose not to answer. Results uncovered that, in one month’s time, participants’ concrete environmental knowledge as well as environmental literacy significantly increased, while environmental (self-)education and environmental citizenship had positive yet insignificant effects. Path analysis revealed that measurements at the second measurement wave did not add any new variance that could not be explained through first wave measurements, highlighting that the development of the investigated variables requires more time.

“What I Want versus What I Will Agree to”—An Analysis of the Views of Ukrainian Refugees toward Work,"Russia’s armed attack on Ukraine on 24 February 2022 started one of the worst refugee crises of the 21st century. It caused involuntary migrations of Ukrainians to other countries, mainly to Europe, and caused the refugees to face the challenge of integrating with the host countries’ labor markets. The aim of this study was to analyze the views of the Ukrainian refugees who migrated to two European countries: Poland and Hungary. We took into account self-esteem, social support, good job expectations, and submissiveness in the labor market. The data were obtained via a survey method using the modified CAPI (Computer-Assisted Personal Interview) technique between 21 November and 20 December 2022 from 807 adult Ukrainian refugees. Results show that disability fosters lower self-esteem, self-assessment of resources, and job demands. Among those who have children, the mean value of self-esteem was higher than in the group without any children. No statistically significant differences were found in the area of professional work. According to the estimation of structural model results, expectations of a good job have a significant, negative effect on the tendency toward submissiveness. The assessment of personal resources and the level of self-esteem have a significant and positive effect on the expectations of a good job. Both a higher level of personal resources and a higher level of self-esteem resulted in higher good job expectations. The assessment of personal resources also has a positive effect on the level of self-esteem. We also found a direct relationship between personal resources, self-esteem, and the tendency toward submissiveness.

Political Beliefs as a Moderator for Predicting Environmental Citizenship through Environmental Education and Environmental Literacy,"Promoting environmental citizenship can be a strong positive force toward addressing our current environmental issues. Informed individuals that act in pro-environmental ways both publicly and privately, as well as engage in civic action aimed at addressing environmental issues, are a substantial force for positive change. However, there is a well-known political divide between the political left and political right, where left-leaning individuals tend to engage more in environmental action that right-leaning individuals. The present study explores whether environmental education and environmental literacy might hold the key for right-wing participation in environmental citizenship. A representative sample of 700 Lithuanian emerging adults (20–39 years of age, mean age 30.6 years, 50% female) was used in the present study. Participants filled in measures of their political orientation, environmental citizenship, environmental literacy, and environmental (self-)education. The results showed that, as expected, left-leaning views were positively associated with environmental citizenship, but when interactions between political orientation and environmental literacy as well as environmental (self-)education were introduced, right-leaning views tended to increase the association between environmental citizenship and environmental literacy as well as environmental (self-)education. The results show a promising outlook toward using quality education to promote environmental citizenship among right-leaning individuals.

"Right-Wing Leftists, Left-Wing Rightists, and Traditionalist Liberals: Core Political Values and Ideological Inconsistency at the Party-Elite Level in Bulgaria","The growth of heterodox ideological configurations, or ideological inconsistencies, among the electorate of Western countries, has been offered as one explanation for recent momentous political events, such as Brexit or the election of Donald Trump as US President. Previous research, however, suggests that ideological inconsistency has been typical for Central and Eastern European (CEE) states for the past thirty years after the fall of the Socialist regimes there. Based on a survey of 102 active members of local and national party structures in Bulgaria, followed by in-depth interviews with the same respondents, I develop a conceptual and methodological approach aimed at objectively measuring Bulgarians’ political values and ideological orientations. Building on previous research on the statistical independence of the social and economic dimensions of ideology, this study identifies three main models of ideological inconsistency at the party-elite level in Bulgaria, offering evidence of the “homogeneity in ideological inconsistency” in this post-Socialist country, with party elites and electorate following the same patterns of inconsistency. The existence of a conservative value complex, integrating traditionalist, statist, and nationalist attitudes regarding the social sphere, is another major finding of the study. I discuss the specific historical and socio-cultural background contributing to ideological inconsistency in Bulgaria and potential implications for the wider CEE region.

Socio-Demographic Differences in Positive Youth Development in Spanish Undergraduates,"The positive youth development (PYD) model is a strength-based conceptualization of the transition to adulthood, in which the relationships that individuals establish within this context are essential. These adaptive contextual–individual interactions allow youths to acquire better psychological adjustment and greater social participation. The PYD model differentiates five areas to be nurtured (the 5Cs) in young people: confidence, competence, connection, caring, and character. The present work aimed to examine differences in overall PYD and its respective 5Cs among Spanish university students based on their socio-demographic characteristics. A cross-sectional study with 1038 students between 18 and 28 years old from 11 Spanish universities was conducted. In order to assess the 5Cs, the Spanish adaptation of the 5Cs of the PYD Short Form was used. When analyzing the variability of the 5Cs according to socio-demographic variables, some relevant differences were found, though with small effect sizes. Students with better scores on the 5Cs included those who were living in the countryside or big cities, studied Social Sciences, were enrolled in small universities, had parents with a high education level, and those who reported high socio-economic status. Women presented higher scores in terms of connection, caring, and character, whereas men reported more perceived competence and confidence, which may be due to gender socialization during adolescence and youth. Families with parents with a higher level of education and of a higher socio-economic level may offer more resources and support greater positive youth development. These social inequalities in PYD may suggest the need for the promotion of equal opportunities in education, health promotion, and social participation, which may allow young people from all backgrounds to develop their individual potential.

Developing and Testing New Domestic Abuse Questions and Approach for the Crime Survey for England and Wales,"Previous research highlighted that a fundamental rethink of the measurement of domestic abuse was needed in the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW). The research reported here aimed to develop and test new questions on domestic abuse for the CSEW to improve the headline prevalence measure, including frequency of abuse, to develop a way of measuring controlling or coercive behavior within the overall prevalence measure, and to develop a measure of the impact of abuse. The research included focus groups and interviews with victims (n = 27) to assess a set of draft questions and cognitive testing of revised questions with victims and the general public (n = 42). A final set of 24 questions was developed for use with victims of both intimate partner and family abuse, with an additional question for family abuse. The new questions were found to echo victim experiences and were deemed acceptable and reliable measures by victims and the general public for domestic abuse, including controlling and/or coercive behavior and impact. An analytical approach was recommended to improve the headline prevalence measure of domestic abuse by establishing ‘high’ and ‘low’ abuse profiles using measures of both behavior and impact.

Child-Led Research with Young Children: Challenging the Ways to Do Research,"Child-led research is gaining increasing attention. Such research involves children leading throughout the research process, from research design to dissemination. Child-led research has tested adult-centric research assumptions, with debates in the literature about researchers’ expertise and responsibilities. If these debates are testing for child-led research undertaken with older children and young people, they are even more so for young children below school-starting age. This article examines child-led research undertaken in a Froebelian early years setting, over 11 months, with 36 children aged between 2 and 5 years, from the adult facilitators’ perspectives. The article utilises the research’s documentation, including mind maps, photographs and story books, songs and video recordings, and an interview undertaken with the facilitating early years practitioner and supporting academic. Learning from this, the article challenges the assumption, in much of the literature on child-led research, that adults need to transmit their knowledge of research methods to children. Instead, a ‘slow pedagogy’ can build on children’s own knowledge, collectively, with time to come to research understandings. The article concludes that child-led research is feasible with young children, but the research process can include or exclude certain forms of children’s communication, making some children more ‘competent’ to undertake research than others.

College Students and Environmental Disasters: A Review of the Literature,"College students are a unique population occupying a distinct life-course and transition period between adolescence and adulthood. Although not monolithic in experiences, knowledge, and demographics, this diverse population is particularly susceptible to immediate, short-term, mid-term, and long-term disaster impacts. Recently, disaster research focusing on college students has rightly focused on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although the pandemic was a public health disaster interrupting social, developmental, and educational processes for students on a global scale, the climate crisis and related environmental disasters continuously threaten college students’ individual development, health, and well-being. Thus, it is critical to understand current knowledge focusing on environmental disasters and college students in order to determine future research needs. This article used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach to examine research on college students and disasters over the past ten years (2014–2023). We identified 67 articles, which we analyzed through a mixed methods approach, including descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results indicate that disaster impacts on college students are an understudied topic in the social sciences, especially in an era of more-frequent and -intense environmental hazards. Our findings demonstrate a need to engage college students in disaster research worldwide so that trade schools, colleges, and universities can collaborate with policymakers to build this unique and disproportionately impacted population’s capacity to mitigate against, respond to, and recover from environmental hazards in an ever-changing climate.

Public Employment Services and Strategic Action towards Rural NEETs in Mediterranean Europe,"The NEET phenomenon in southern Europe is particularly alarming. Most studies have focused on analysing the socio-demographic characteristics of NEET and policies directed towards them, but more research is needed regarding the psychological aspects that underlie this condition. This paper, grounded in the bioecological model, aims to analyse the psychological dimensions regarding the functioning of Public Employment Services (PESs) in three countries that rely on the South Mediterranean welfare model. Between November 2022 and September 2023, research was conducted across six rural PES locations in Italy, Spain, and Portugal, based on interviews and focus groups with PES operators and young NEET users. Thematic analysis identified two central axes: Enhancing Relationships and Building Strategic Action, which were crucial for improving NEET-PES interactions and fostering connections between PES and other community entities. The results highlighted the importance of psychological elements in the effective involvement of NEETs in policy initiatives.

Rethinking the Vulnerability of Groups Targeted in Health-Promoting Sports and Physical Activity Programs,"Vulnerability and related terms are increasingly used to describe the target groups of health-promoting programs involving sports and physical activity. Yet, such terms are often left undefined, creating an image of vulnerability that reinforces the health inequities the programs seek to counter. This article aims to reconceptualize vulnerability to help researchers and program personnel describe and support individuals and groups in vulnerable positions. To do so, we conceptualize vulnerability as a contentious phenomenon, emphasizing the spectrum between individual and community perspectives on vulnerability, along with between experts’ evaluation of (health) risks and lived vulnerability. We illustrate the utility of this elaborate conceptualization of vulnerability through a single case study of a walking program organized by a health promotion unit in a so-called deprived area in Denmark. Interviewing the health professionals, it was not surprising to identify that experts’ evaluations of risks are key to the program. However, employing the conceptual framework in its entirety, we also find indications of lived vulnerability and resistance towards their conditions among the program participants. We conclude that it is relevant for both researchers and program employees to consider the complete spectrum of risks and lived vulnerabilities, along with providing support not only to individuals in need but also to their communities.

Reciprocal Communication and Political Deliberation on Twitter,"Social media platforms such as Twitter/X are increasingly important for political communication but the empirical question as to whether such communication enhances democratic consensus building (the ideal of deliberative democracy) or instead contributes to societal polarisation via fostering of hate speech and “information disorders” such as echo chambers is worth exploring. Political deliberation involves reciprocal communication between users, but much of the recent research into politics on social media has focused on one-to-many communication, in particular the sharing and diffusion of information on Twitter via retweets. This paper presents a new approach to studying reciprocal political communication on Twitter, with a focus on extending network-analytic indicators of deliberation. We use the Twitter v2 API to collect a new dataset (#debatenight2020) of reciprocal communication on Twitter during the first debate of the 2020 US presidential election and show that a hashtag-based collection alone would have collected only 1% of the debate-related communication. Previous work into using social network analysis to measure deliberation has involved using discussion tree networks to quantify the extent of argumentation (maximum depth) and representation (maximum width); we extend these measures by explicitly incorporating reciprocal communication (via triad census) and the political partisanship of users (inferred via usage of partisan hashtags). Using these methods, we find evidence for reciprocal communication among partisan actors, but also point to a need for further research to understand what forms this communication takes.

Why Gerontology Needs Anthropology: Toward an Applied Anthropological Gerontology,"In this essay, we argue that gerontologists should increase their engagement with anthropologists to increase transdisciplinary collaboration, fulfill the interdisciplinary promise of gerontology as a field, and to ensure the work of anthropologists is formed by, and employed in, situations where meaningful engagement with practitioners and policymakers can lead to social change. Anthropology is the study of human societies in historical, biological, and sociocultural context, comprising a holistic field of study that can contribute unique methods, approaches, and theories to the field of gerontology. Although increasing amounts of anthropological scholarship have focused on older adulthood, this critical work of anthropologists still needs to be utilized by those in positions of power to enact change. Furthermore, the work conducted by anthropologists of aging has not consistently been recognized as anthropological scholarship. Therefore, a notable gap exists between the promise of the anthropology of aging and the utilization of the field, its findings, and engagement with the broader gerontological academy. As such, the contributions of anthropology to aging scholarship and the resulting reduction in inequities in the aging experience are not always adequately recognized. By examining the history of anthropology’s engagement with aging and the lifecourse, we argue for a more applied anthropological gerontology. We conclude with a call to action to ensure that anthropological gerontology is seen as a fundamental branch of scholarship, both within anthropology and gerontology, which can be used to improve the lived experiences of older adults globally.

"Trust, Corruption, and Tax Compliance in Fragile States: On a Quest for Transforming Africa into Future Global Powerhouse","This study explores the complex relationship between trust, corruption, and tax compliance in fragile states. It examines factors influencing public trust in three government branches: the ruling party (a proxy for the executive), the parliament, and the local government, and examines whether trust in these arms of government impacts tax compliance. We conducted this investigation using Afrobarometer survey data from Guinea, Mali, Sudan, and Zimbabwe as case studies. The study found that restoring public trust and promoting tax compliance are tangible outcomes arising from a steadfast commitment to electoral integrity, transparency, and accountability. This interplay becomes more vital within the framework of state fragility, where institutions are highly strained. The study highlighted that the existence of rampant corruption reduces trust in the ruling party, parliament, and local government council. Furthermore, the joint interaction between corruption and lack of trust significantly undermines the willingness of taxpayers to adhere to tax administration laws. These insights emphasise that combating corruption becomes not only a governance step but also vital to state stability. Thus, African governments should prioritise electoral integrity and combat corruption through enhanced accountability to pave the way for improved governance, enhanced trust, and a more stable path toward a global powerhouse.

Enhancing Early Risk Detection for Reduced Earning Capacity: The Development of the padaCura App,"In Germany, 1.7 million individuals received reduced earning capacity pensions in 2020, but reintegrating them into the labor market remains challenging. For individuals who have a reduced earning capacity, this often leads to adverse consequences (e.g., low quality of life, poverty, social stigma). The project ‘Cooperation for prevention, fitness and health in the job center (KOPF22)’ focuses on early risk detection and prevention strategies for clients of the job center (who are recipients of Citizen’s Income) as they face various challenges in maintaining their ability to work. The padaCura App, a key component of the project, assesses the risk of reduced earning capacity using an ICF-based questionnaire. It offers immediate feedback reports to clients, categorizing their risk levels and suggesting actions in plain language with visual aids. Since the project emphasizes the client’s autonomy and voluntary participation, clients decide how to proceed with their results. If they decide to cooperate with the job center, then several offers for prevention and intervention measures can be used to increase employability. The first evaluations of the app and the questionnaire demonstrate its effectiveness in differentiating between employable persons and incapacitated individuals. Future developments should focus on enhancing the result reports to include more targeted interventions and on collaboration between employment support resources and healthcare systems to meet clients’ needs.

"Angels at the Top, Rocks at the Bottom: Naturalized Inequality in Brazilian Conservative Thought","Racialized social inequality is considered a structural problem in Brazil and has been a political priority of recent progressist governments. This understanding is not backed up by the so-called New Right, who understands inequality as an inherent principle of a God-given “order” and question of personal capability and merit. In this study, I explore the ideological roots of this powerful Rightist narrative by looking at the Brazilian canon of traditional conservative thought and its influence on New Right discourse. The results show that the core ideas stem from neo-Thomist interpretations of late-scholastic scholarship, which were promoted in Brazil through the Vatican’s integrist reaction to modernization during the First Republic. Since then, Brazilian conservatives have successfully used these religious legitimizations of naturalized inequality to constrain State-driven social reformism and join forces with neoliberalism through the invention of the supposed late scholastic roots of the Austrian School of Economics. After redemocratization, a recycled version of this liberal-conservative claim for less “State” and more “Brazil” (as guided by theocratic traditional order), promoted mainly by the philosopher and online influencer Olavo de Carvalho, has fueled the desecularizing discourse of the New Right and their attempt to conserve the colonial social hierarchy in Brazil.

Providing Consumer Credit to Low-Income Populations in Brazil—The Case of Complexo da Penha,"The financial inclusion (FI) literature claims that expanding access of the poor to consumer credit in the formal financial system is an instrument to alleviate poverty. This view has been increasingly challenged by the financialization literature, which highlights unsustainable indebtedness of low-income borrowers following the introduction of FI policies. While a welcome contribution and antidote to mainstream assessments, much of the financialization literature on Brazil has, to date, focused on a macro-oriented analysis. As a major testing ground for FI, a better understanding of these dynamics in Latin America’s largest country deepens our understanding of the socio-economic consequences of inserting poor populations into the financial system. This paper contributes to the financialization literature by drawing on interviews conducted in a Rio de Janeiro slum to understand how debt dynamics operate in everyday life, along with its structural conditioners. It shows that FI policies provide limited consumption smoothing and instead increase the structural vulnerability of low-income households. Wage and welfare support along with greater oversight and control of financial products supplied to low-income borrowers are warranted.

Enhancing the Competitiveness of the Show Business Industry for Cultural Export as a Means of Creative Economy Development and Tourism Promotion in the Future New Normal Era: The Case of Thailand,"The tourism industry is considered the greatest economic generator in Thailand. Nonetheless, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic thoroughly shifted its image of tourism stability and trustworthiness. The show business industry is an element of Thai tourism that attracts more than a million tourists nationwide. The show business industry not only attracts quality multinational tourists as visitors, but also indirectly establishes ‘soft power’ with audiences. This research aimed to (1) study the alternative future scenario of Thailand’s cultural show business industry with respect to cultural export and the creative economy; (2) determine the competitive potential of Thailand’s show business industry by comparing it with the global show business industry; (3) examine the market demands and behaviors within Thailand’s cultural show business industry for cultural export and the creative economy; and (4) present a strategy for elevating the competitive potential of the show business industry for cultural export, promoting a creative economy and fostering tourism in the post-pandemic ‘New Normal’ era. The results of this study found that the ‘Alternative Future Scenario’ of Thailand’s cultural performance industry with respect to cultural exports and the creative economy consists of three scenarios: (1) a mass show business tourism industry, (2) an exclusive show business tourism industry, and (3) a new mega show business tourism industry. It also revealed the competitive potential of the Thai show business industry. By comparing it with the international performing arts industry in terms of competitiveness, it was found that the show business industry in Thailand meets world-class standards. Given its clear, outstanding, and unique culture and traditions, Thailand is ready to serve as a major cultural exporter via cultural performance. Furthermore, the data analysis revealed a total of 10 significant strategies for enhancing the competitiveness of the show business industry in Thailand.

Highly Educated Women: Exploring Barriers and Strategies for Labour Integration in an Emotional Migratory Process,"This article explores the barriers and the strategies of a group of highly educated foreign women to obtain a job-education matching situation in the Basque Country (Spain) where they all permanently settled following a binational heterosexual marriage. Drawing on 21 biographical interviews with women from Latin America and Europe, we examine new perspectives on the complexity and fluidity between their professional pathways and family projects. For that, we apply an intersectional lens to analyse their life experience. Our results show that respondents involved in a feminised labour market (education and health) have fewer difficulties to find a job-education match. In other cases, becoming self-employed is a way to gain independence and flexibility by running an open market-oriented business. Interviewees identified language, lack of personal networks, family reconciliation, traditional gender roles and the transferring of cultural capital as the main barriers for their incorporation into the labour market. The study finds that marriage support is not enough to overcome the barriers. We argue that for a more comprehensive understanding of labour integration of highly educated migrant women, motivation and agency, linked to family support, should be considered factors to cope with structural inequalities.

Socio-Phenomenological Reflections on What Digital Death Brings and Denies in Terms of Relational Experiences to Orthodox Romanians,"Informed by Alfred Schütz’s phenomenology of social relations and its recent developments addressing online relationality, this essay reflects on the differences between online and offline death-related experiences in contemporary Romania. In Orthodox death cultures, religious, social, and familial bonds overlap. Orthodox Christianity is sceptical about body–mind separation and values unmediated liturgical communities. It is, thus, pertinent to ask what death online brings and denies in terms of experience to Romanian internet users. Some preliminary findings from our fieldwork are discussed. So far, on Romanian Facebook, three clusters of experience emerged widely: 1. A realm of belief where faith, unchallenged by digital practices, “decodes” deadly events across life-worlds; 2. Experiences of resistance and ambivalence of those who are stuck “in-between“, that is, those less competent in their traditions, yet sceptical about digital change; 3. Death experiences seem less synchronised across life-worlds for those who value electronic proximity: digital death and real death obey different rules. Historical specificity, we shall conclude, sets typified combinations of motives for what Romanians do in the proximity of death and how they do it. Digital technologies modulate the “hows” and, less notably, the “whats”.

Emotional Status and Psychological Well-Being in the Educational Opposition Process,"The process to become a public teacher in Spain involves a very strict examination. In order to pass this exam, a high level of emotional competence is required. During the preparation for this test, symptoms related to anxiety, depression and stress are experienced. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of negative emotional state on emotional intelligence and psychological wellbeing as a function of the number of sittings in the competitive examination process. The research design was quantitative and exploratory. The sample consisted of 3578 candidates. The results show an increase in the effect of negative emotional states on emotional intelligence and psychological well-being in candidates who have taken part in the selection process more than twice. It is concluded that negative emotional states increase in their effect on emotional and psychological well-being as the number of exams taken increases.

Promises and Pitfalls of Intersectional Politics: The Black Coalition for Rights in Brazil,"Based on evidence collected in a collaborative research project, this article studies the Black Coalition for Rights created in Brazil in 2019. Compared to previous experiences of antiracist struggles in Brazil, the Coalition stands out for its decentralized organization, its ability to convey political content through adequate aesthetic forms, its capillarity in the domestic sphere, and its transnational articulations. Equally striking is its intersectional character understood as both the emphasis on the transversal character of racism and the stress of the interdependent character of social struggles against different forms of inequalities (with regard to gender, race, class, etc.). The Coalition has so far proven to be particularly successful in terms of its mobilization capacity, its public visibility, and its agenda-setting power. According to our preliminary findings, its success can be explained, to a great extent, by its ability to vocalize a broad set of political claims and, consequently, to fill the gap left by other civil society actors demobilized by the far right-wing backlash in Brazil and the pandemic. Since January 2023, in the context of a new progressive government, the Coalition has started facing difficulties in preserving its intersectional and socially encompassing character.

Rethinking the Vulnerability of Groups Targeted in Health-Promoting Sports and Physical Activity Programs,"Vulnerability and related terms are increasingly used to describe the target groups of health-promoting programs involving sports and physical activity. Yet, such terms are often left undefined, creating an image of vulnerability that reinforces the health inequities the programs seek to counter. This article aims to reconceptualize vulnerability to help researchers and program personnel describe and support individuals and groups in vulnerable positions. To do so, we conceptualize vulnerability as a contentious phenomenon, emphasizing the spectrum between individual and community perspectives on vulnerability, along with between experts’ evaluation of (health) risks and lived vulnerability. We illustrate the utility of this elaborate conceptualization of vulnerability through a single case study of a walking program organized by a health promotion unit in a so-called deprived area in Denmark. Interviewing the health professionals, it was not surprising to identify that experts’ evaluations of risks are key to the program. However, employing the conceptual framework in its entirety, we also find indications of lived vulnerability and resistance towards their conditions among the program participants. We conclude that it is relevant for both researchers and program employees to consider the complete spectrum of risks and lived vulnerabilities, along with providing support not only to individuals in need but also to their communities.

Reciprocal Communication and Political Deliberation on Twitter,"Social media platforms such as Twitter/X are increasingly important for political communication but the empirical question as to whether such communication enhances democratic consensus building (the ideal of deliberative democracy) or instead contributes to societal polarisation via fostering of hate speech and “information disorders” such as echo chambers is worth exploring. Political deliberation involves reciprocal communication between users, but much of the recent research into politics on social media has focused on one-to-many communication, in particular the sharing and diffusion of information on Twitter via retweets. This paper presents a new approach to studying reciprocal political communication on Twitter, with a focus on extending network-analytic indicators of deliberation. We use the Twitter v2 API to collect a new dataset (#debatenight2020) of reciprocal communication on Twitter during the first debate of the 2020 US presidential election and show that a hashtag-based collection alone would have collected only 1% of the debate-related communication. Previous work into using social network analysis to measure deliberation has involved using discussion tree networks to quantify the extent of argumentation (maximum depth) and representation (maximum width); we extend these measures by explicitly incorporating reciprocal communication (via triad census) and the political partisanship of users (inferred via usage of partisan hashtags). Using these methods, we find evidence for reciprocal communication among partisan actors, but also point to a need for further research to understand what forms this communication takes.

Why Gerontology Needs Anthropology: Toward an Applied Anthropological Gerontology,"In this essay, we argue that gerontologists should increase their engagement with anthropologists to increase transdisciplinary collaboration, fulfill the interdisciplinary promise of gerontology as a field, and to ensure the work of anthropologists is formed by, and employed in, situations where meaningful engagement with practitioners and policymakers can lead to social change. Anthropology is the study of human societies in historical, biological, and sociocultural context, comprising a holistic field of study that can contribute unique methods, approaches, and theories to the field of gerontology. Although increasing amounts of anthropological scholarship have focused on older adulthood, this critical work of anthropologists still needs to be utilized by those in positions of power to enact change. Furthermore, the work conducted by anthropologists of aging has not consistently been recognized as anthropological scholarship. Therefore, a notable gap exists between the promise of the anthropology of aging and the utilization of the field, its findings, and engagement with the broader gerontological academy. As such, the contributions of anthropology to aging scholarship and the resulting reduction in inequities in the aging experience are not always adequately recognized. By examining the history of anthropology’s engagement with aging and the lifecourse, we argue for a more applied anthropological gerontology. We conclude with a call to action to ensure that anthropological gerontology is seen as a fundamental branch of scholarship, both within anthropology and gerontology, which can be used to improve the lived experiences of older adults globally.

"Trust, Corruption, and Tax Compliance in Fragile States: On a Quest for Transforming Africa into Future Global Powerhouse","This study explores the complex relationship between trust, corruption, and tax compliance in fragile states. It examines factors influencing public trust in three government branches: the ruling party (a proxy for the executive), the parliament, and the local government, and examines whether trust in these arms of government impacts tax compliance. We conducted this investigation using Afrobarometer survey data from Guinea, Mali, Sudan, and Zimbabwe as case studies. The study found that restoring public trust and promoting tax compliance are tangible outcomes arising from a steadfast commitment to electoral integrity, transparency, and accountability. This interplay becomes more vital within the framework of state fragility, where institutions are highly strained. The study highlighted that the existence of rampant corruption reduces trust in the ruling party, parliament, and local government council. Furthermore, the joint interaction between corruption and lack of trust significantly undermines the willingness of taxpayers to adhere to tax administration laws. These insights emphasise that combating corruption becomes not only a governance step but also vital to state stability. Thus, African governments should prioritise electoral integrity and combat corruption through enhanced accountability to pave the way for improved governance, enhanced trust, and a more stable path toward a global powerhouse.

Unaccompanied or Separated Migrant Children and Adolescents at the Colombian–Venezuelan Border: Loss of the Social Moratorium and Its Implications,"This study explains the Venezuelan migration involving unaccompanied or separated adolescents (UASA) on the Colombian–Venezuelan border, specifically in Norte de Santander-Táchira. This explanation is framed within the concept of the social moratorium, highlighting three subcategories that contribute to the early abandonment of childhood: 1. the violation of rights, 2. working life, and 3. confrontation of dangers. These subcategories compel UASA to transition prematurely into youth, assuming social, labor, or family responsibilities. Methodologically, we adopt a narrative approach, conducting group interviews with 24 immigrant children and adolescents. Furthermore, 14 interviews are conducted in 2 local markets, and the remaining 10 on 2 central avenues in the city of Cúcuta, Colombia. We conduct a theoretical analysis drawing upon key concepts, including the social moratorium, social constructionism, interaction, and moral and cognitive development. This theoretical framework helps us understand the consequences for the life prospects of this generation. They arise from factors such as school dropout, exposure to health risks, and the absence of free leisure time. These indicators reflect socioeconomic problems, including poverty, abuse, and violence.

This disparity is an environmental justice concern. Project FRESH Air is educating the community through STEM outreach with sensors for monitoring particulate matter, student projects, curriculum development, and wider community engagement in order to educate for environmental justice.

"“Non-Corrupt Government”: Less Than Good, More Than Impartial","In recent years, the study of corruption has become one of the most prominent in the social sciences. If there is corruption, however, it is because something has been corrupted; something pure has been sullied. This pure element serves mainly as a normative reference: It may never have constituted a social and political reality. However, the purpose of this article is to try to define what its components might be. In this way, theoretical considerations can be used to provide a more solid basis for the fight against corruption. The position of this paper is that the opposite of corruption should be explicitly defined without the use of abstract categories such as good governance or integrity. The paper will begin with a discussion of the concept of “non-corrupt government” and then proceed to a theoretical analysis of the main issues involved. It will conclude with some practical remarks on how to build, in the most parsimonious way, the benchmark of quality that corruption undermines.

Assessment of Entrepreneurial Potential in the Training of a New Generation of Change Agents in Spain,"The development of entrepreneurial potential in the training of school-age pupils is relevant for carrying out projects of an innovative and transformative nature. Entrepreneurial training is enacted through Spanish educational regulations, in relation to the development of the key entrepreneurial competence. Thus, a training programme in entrepreneurial potential for school-age students, who are considered as agents of change, was evaluated under the approach of “enterprise education pedagogy”. For this purpose, an experimental research study, pre-test and post-test, with a control and experimental group, was designed. The sample consisted of 1036 participants from eight autonomous communities in Spain. The data analysis was carried out by means of a t-test to compare the mean before and after the application of the programme on the total number of participants, as well as on the subgroups with and without entrepreneurial intentions. The results show that the PEIEO programme had a positive effect on entrepreneurial potential. The experimental group, compared to the control group, significantly increased their total score in the t-test, as well as for each dimension of entrepreneurial potential. Similarly, the participants considered to have entrepreneurial intentions further increased their entrepreneurial potential compared to the group considered to have no entrepreneurial intentions. Consequently, the results indicate that entrepreneurship education, in a holistic sense, has a relevant impact on entrepreneurial potential in a programme aimed at training agents of change.

Surveillance Capitalism in Mental Health: When Good Apps Go Rogue (and What Can Be Done about It),"Research shows that a large proportion of the world’s population has experience with mental health difficulties, and reliable as well as scalable care is urgently needed. Digital mental health seems to be an obvious solution to provide the better delivery of care but also the delivery of better care. With an imagined future of real-time information sharing, improved diagnosis and monitoring of mental health conditions, and remote care, supported by advances in artificial intelligence, many tech companies have emerged over the last three decades to plug the treatment gap and provide services. The evidence base seems compelling: some online treatments have the capability to treat individuals quite successfully. However, the introduction, utilisation, and expansion of digital mental health technologies have not always focused on public health only. Using a surveillance capitalism perspective, this paper approaches the democratisation–privatisation dichotomy in digital mental health with a critical lens. In particular, the paper details how (commercially valuable) mental health data are extracted, “shared”, and claimed as an asset by big tech companies. Reviewing the terms, conditions, and practices of ten popular mental health apps, the paper polemically argues that mental digital health cannot unlock real value for society—better treatment, good quality care, and efficient delivery—if power, politics, and profits remain in the hands of big tech companies. To conclude, the paper draws attention to contemporary discourses that seek to promote democracy and public value for digital mental health apps, technologies, and solutions.

Work–Life Conflict and Job Satisfaction: The Moderating Role of Gender and Household Income in Western Europe,"Although many potential moderators of the work–life conflict and job satisfaction relationship are well-studied, previous research has often overlooked the potential influence of different income groups on this dynamic. Our aim in this paper is to test this moderation effect within the context of Western Europe. Additionally, we carry out the analysis for men and women separately, as this dynamic may be strongly influenced by gender. Using data from the tenth round of the European Social Survey for twelve countries (Belgium, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and Switzerland), we found a significant positive moderating effect of household income on the relationship between work–life conflict and job satisfaction for women, while for men the moderation effect is not significant. Our results thus suggest that for women, higher household income may serve as a buffer, alleviating the detrimental impact of individual work–life conflict on job satisfaction.

Boundaries of Parental Consent: The Example of Hypospadias Surgery,"Human rights organisations raise concerns about medical interventions on children with intersex variations, particularly when these interventions impinge on the child’s bodily autonomy and are without a sound biomedical basis. Psychosocial literature and legal literature have made very different contributions to thinking about the healthcare of people with intersex variations, but both literatures pay attention to the process of informing patients about elective interventions and the workings of consent. The present paper addresses the absence of dialogue across medical, legal, and psychosocial literatures on the surgical treatment of children with intersex variations. The analysis presented in this paper focusses on the assumptions underpinning the practice of allowing parents to consent on behalf of their children to elective surgery in the instance of hypospadias. In this paper, we (i) introduce consent from a medico-legal perspective, (ii) analyse selected documents (including medical, psychosocial, and human rights documents) in relation to the concept of parental consent on behalf of a child, and (iii) reconsider the current practice of inviting parents to give consent for elective genital surgery on infants. What emerges from our analysis is a picture of long-term relationships and interactions over time within which the consent process is located. The focus is not whether consent is granted, but whether free and informed consent is granted. This picture allows us to expand the understanding of “informed consent,” highlighting the importance of producing ethical interactions between health professionals and patients with the view that these relationships last for years. Understanding consent as a process, considering information as dynamic, partial, and negotiated, and understanding the doctor–patient interaction as relational might enable us to imagine the kind of informed consent process that genuinely works for everyone concerned. Our examination of selected legal, medical, and psychosocial texts raises doubt about whether current hospital practice meets the requirement of informed parental consent on behalf of children undergoing hypospadias surgery.

Digital Activism Masked―The Fridays for Future Movement and the “Global Day of Climate Action”: Testing Social Function and Framing Typologies of Claims on Twitter,"This article analyzed the Fridays for Future (FFF) movement and its online mobilization around the Global Day of Climate Action on 25 September 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this event is a unique opportunity to study digital activism as marchers were considered not appropriate. Using Twitter’s API with keywords “#climateStrike”, and “#FridaysForFuture”, we collected 111,844 unique tweets and retweets from 47,892 unique users. We used two typologies based on social media activism and framing literature to understand the main function of tweets (information opinion, mobilization, and blame) and their framing (diagnosis, prognosis, and motivational). We also analyzed its relationship and tested its automated classification potential. To do so we manually coded a randomly selected sample of 950 tweets that were used as input for the automated classification process (SVM algorithm with balancing classification techniques). We found that the automated classification of the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to not increase the mobilization function of tweets, as the frequencies of mobilization tweets were low. We also found a balanced diversity of framing tasks, with an important number of tweets that envisaged solutions to legislation and policy changes. COVID-related tweets were less frequently prognostically framed. We found that both typologies were not independent. Tweets with a blaming function tended to be framed in a prognostic way and therefore were related to possible solutions. The automated data classification model performed well, especially across social function typology and the “other” category. This indicated that these tools could help researchers working with social media data to process the information across categories that are currently mainly processed manually.

The Participation of Students with Autism in Educational Robotics: A Scoping Review,"Educational robotics (ER) is a growing interdisciplinary field that is attracting increasing attention in inclusive or special education settings. It provides a suitable educational environment for the participation of students with autism, through which they can utilize their main strengths and interests. Strengths-based vs. deficits-based approaches recognize the strengths and interests of autistic children as the starting point for their inclusion in school and the community. The scoping review was developed as the best knowledge-synthesis method for summarizing the pertinent research on the participation of students with autism in educational robotics for their successful inclusion. Forty-five studies were included and analyzed to address the main objectives, the mapping of contextual dimensions, and the specific characteristics of the educational robotic activities where the participation of students with autism occurred. The data were extracted into a charting framework, and a narrative analysis was adopted for the knowledge synthesis. According to the results, the research on the participation of children with autism is limited and has focused primarily on educational robotic activities, failing to adequately explore other dimensions that affect the successful participation and inclusion of students with autism in educational robotics.

"Gender Roles, Gender Bias, and Cultural Influences: Perceptions of Male and Female UAE Public Relations Professionals","Research into gender dynamics in the Public Relations (PR) industry has suggested that the gendered perceptions of PR roles, gender bias, and cultural norms may contribute to gender-related issues in the field. The current study, framed as an exploratory investigation, examines how PR professionals in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) perceive gender equality issues within their industry. Drawing on survey responses from 152 PR practitioners in the UAE, this research investigates the extent to which these professionals perceive gender equality issues in the PR sector. The survey results reveal positive perceptions of gender equality issues, although some specific gender-related concerns emerge. One key finding is that there are minimal gender differences in perceiving gender equality issues between male and female professionals. Respondents also expressed confidence that their organizations are implementing practices in support of gender equality and recognizing the impact of such practices on employee performance. Given the lack of data on gender equality in the UAE, this exploratory study contributes to a better understanding of gender equality among professionals and provides insights into the strategies for advancing gender equality in the sector.

Motivations to Collect: How Consumers Are Socialized to Build Product Collections,"Most people have collected products at some point in their lives; however, little is known about how people are socialized to collect. This mixed methods study recruited 213 participants to explain and explore the influences of family, friends, romantic partners, and online social media on the continued intention to build product collections. Qualitative findings revealed a clear pattern of familial influences when participants shared how their collections started. When starting collections, participants acquired products through either personal interest in the products or receiving gifts from family members. However, quantitative results indicate that friends, romantic partners, and social media have a greater influence after the product collection has started. The results and findings of this study also guide an adaptation of the consumer socialization theory.

Phenomenon-Based Learning in Teaching a Foreign Language: Experiences of Lithuanian Teachers,"Phenomenon-based learning (hereinafter PhenoBL) is widely studied in the majority of European countries, especially given that research data indicate that PhenoBL is more successful in providing effective learning, better student achievement, a stronger interest in science, and even a higher happiness index. However, there are sparse data on the educational practice of this method in Lithuania, particularly in foreign language teaching (FLT). Thus, teachers’ professional preparation for the effective implementation of PhenoBL remains one of the most relevant research problems. For this reason, this study aims to analyse the experiences of Lithuanian foreign language teachers in incorporating PhenoBL into FLT. Fifteen individual semi-structured interviews were conducted, and the obtained data were analysed by applying qualitative inductive content analysis. An inductive content analysis of the interview reports revealed six themes and related categories: the perception of student-centred teaching, the development of subject integration competencies, teamwork development competencies, research-planning skills, the positioning of personal responsibilities and duties, and foreign language usage emancipation, i.e. setting free from personal fears (fear to make grammar, vocabulary mistakes, while speaking in public) to speak a foreign languages. The content of the revealed themes indicated that teachers highlighted the flexibility of PhenoBL from the perspective of its application to different language learning levels within one group. The majority of the respondents underlined the necessity for the development of an active didactic competence. Other respondents mentioned the importance of the correlation between personal creativity competence development and success in PhenoBL. It was also stressed that if a teacher wants to be successful while using PhenoB, they must to be prepared to work with integration-based and communication-emancipatory methods, must be student-centred, must have competencies in teaching several subjects, must be good at teamwork, and must be good at managing learning time.

The Long Arm of the State: Transnational Repression against Exiled Activists from the Arab Gulf States,"The Arab Spring was a period of intense activism demanding democracy and freedom that swept across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. While previous research has focused on the role of diaspora communities in the uprisings and the strategies employed by regimes to suppress them, it has primarily centered on countries that experienced large-scale revolutions and endured severe consequences. Consequently, the current literature has failed to explore the situation of Arab Gulf dissidents living in exile, instead focusing on a few isolated incidents. This paper examines the transnational repression (TR) campaign of the Arab Gulf states (AGSs). Drawing on the literature about the long arm of authoritarianism and TR, this paper explores the various TR methods employed by the AGSs to silence activists living abroad. The paper finds that the nature of TR in the Arab Gulf region is unique when compared with other MENA countries. The TR campaign of AGSs is alarmingly expanding, using various mechanisms and resources, making the region one of the world’s leading perpetrators. The methods employed by the AGSs include travel bans as part of their coercion by proxy, digital transnational repression, and the use of multilateral organizations as tools of repression. Additionally, this paper highlights the AGSs’ support of other countries’ TR.

Study on the Influence of Water Erosion on the Bearing Capacity and Function of the High Pile Foundation of the Wharf,"High-pile foundation is a common form of deep foundation commonly used in ocean environments, such as docks and bridge sites. Aiming at the problem of bearing capacity of high pile foundations, this paper proposes the calculation of bearing capacity and the analysis of scour depth of high pile foundations under the action of scour based on the modified p-y curve. In this paper, three kinds of scour mechanisms—natural evolution scour, general scour, and local scour—are described; and the calculation methods of scour widely used at present are compared and analyzed. The solution of the vertical stress of soil around the pile under local scour is solved and applied to the β method to solve the lateral resistance of the pile under local scour. The local erosion is equivalent to the whole erosion, and the expression of the ultimate soil resistance before and after the equivalent is calculated, respectively, according to the principle that the ultimate soil resistance at a certain point above the equivalent pile end remains unchanged. The distance from the equivalent soil surface to the pile end can be obtained simultaneously, and then the equivalent erosion depth, p-y curve of sand at different depths, and high pile bearing capacity can be obtained. Finally, it is found that the bending moment of a single pile body varies along the pile body in the form of a parabola, and the maximum bending moment of the pile body is below the mud surface and increases with the increase in horizontal load. When the scouring depth is 30 m, the horizontal load is 25 KN, and the maximum bending moment of the pile body is about 150 N·m. The data with a relative error greater than 10% accounted for only 16.6% of the total data, and the error between the calculated value and the measured value was small. The formula can predict the erosion depth more accurately.

Examining the Effects of Soil and Water Conservation Measures on Patterns and Magnitudes of Vegetation Cover Change in a Subtropical Region Using Time Series Landsat Imagery,"Soil and water erosion has long been regarded as a serious environmental problem in the world. Thus, research on reducing soil erosion has received continuous attention. Different conservation measures such as restoring low-function forests, closing hillsides for afforestation, planting trees and grass, and constructing terraces on slope land have been implemented for controlling soil erosion problems and promoting vegetation cover change. One important task is to understand the effects of different conservation measures on reducing water and soil erosion problems. However, directly conducting the evaluation of soil erosion reduction is difficult. One solution is to evaluate the patterns and magnitudes of vegetation cover change due to implementing these measures. Therefore, this research selected Changting County, Fujian Province as a case study to examine the effects of implementing conservation measures on vegetation cover change based on time series Landsat images and field survey data. Landsat images between 1986 and 2021 were used to produce time series vegetation cover data using the Google Earth Engine. Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2021 and Landsat images in 2010 were separately used to develop land cover maps using the random forest method. The spatial distribution of different conservation measures was linked to annual vegetation cover and land cover change data to examine the effects on the change in vegetation cover. The results showed a significant reduction in bare lands and increase in pine forests. The vegetation coverage increased from 42% in 1986 to 79% in 2021 in the conservation region compared with an increase from 73% to 87% in the non-conservation region during the same period. Of the different conservation measures, the change magnitude was 0.44 for restoring low-function forests and closing hillsides for afforestation and 0.65 for multiple control measures. This research provides new insights in terms of understanding the effects of taking proper measures for reducing soil and water erosion problems and provides scientific results for decisionmaking for soil erosion controls. The strategy and method used in this research are valuable for other regions in understanding the roles of different conservation measures on vegetation cover change and soil erosion reduction through employing remote sensing technologies.

Empowering Vocational Students: A Research-Based Framework for Computational Thinking Integration,"Vocational Education and Training (VET) faces significant challenges in equipping individuals for modern workplaces, which increasingly require digital literacy and Computational Thinking (CT) skills. This paper addresses the imperative of integrating CT into VET programs and outlines key research questions. Our methodology primarily involves a systematic literature review, resulting in the identification of 29 relevant papers. Through qualitative content analysis, we develop a CT integration framework that connects CT practices and integration elements to the engineering design process, while highlighting the VET context. Arguably, the innovative aspect of this framework lies in its core dimensions of harnessing computational power for enhanced efficiency. Raising the question of whether computers can optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of specific tasks is paramount for addressing challenges in technology-rich environments. Therefore, this inquiry merits unwavering attention at every stage of the process. The proposed framework provides educators with a structured approach to identify integration opportunities and help prepare students for multifaceted vocational careers. Furthermore, other key findings underscore the inherently interdisciplinary nature of VET, the growing demand for STEM competencies, and the transformative potential of CT integration. Implications emphasize the need for further research, supportive policies, and practical CT integration. Despite limitations, this study strongly advocates for CT integration, empowering VET students for success in the contemporary workforce.

Magnetically Suspended Control Sensitive Gyroscope Rotor High-Precision Deflection Decoupling Method using Quantum Neural Network and Fractional-Order Terminal Sliding Mode Control,"To achieve high-precision deflection control of a Magnetically Suspended Control and Sensitive Gyroscope rotor under high dynamic conditions, a deflection decoupling method using Quantum Radial Basis Function Neural Network and fractional-order terminal sliding mode control is proposed. The convergence speed and time complexity of the neural network controller limit the control accuracy and stability of rotor deflection under high-bandwidth conditions. To solve the problem, a quantum-computing-based structure optimization method for the Radial Basis Function Neural Network is proposed for the first time, where the input and the center of hidden layer basis function of the neural network are quantum-coded, and quantum rotation gates are designed to replace the Gaussian function. The parallel characteristic of quantum computing is utilized to reduce the time complexity and improve the convergence speed of the neural network. On top of that, in order to further address the issue of input jitter, a fractional-order terminal sliding mode controller based on the Quantum Radial Basis Function Neural Network is designed, the fractional-order differential sliding mode surface and the fractional-order convergence law are proposed to reduce the input jitter and achieve finite-time convergence of the controller, and the Quantum Radial Basis Function Neural Network is used to approximate the residual coupling and external disturbances of the system, resulting in improving the rotor deflection control accuracy. The semi-physical simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

Experimental Investigation of Mechanical Properties of Concrete Mix with Lightweight Expanded Polystyrene and Steel Fibers,"The demand for lightweight aggregates in concrete compositions for diverse structural and non-structural applications in contemporary building construction has increased. This is to achieve a controllable low-density lightweight concrete, which reduces the overall structural weight. However, the challenge lies in achieving an appropriate strength in lightweight concrete while maintaining a lower unit weight. This research aims to evaluate the performance of lightweight concrete by integrating expanded polystyrene (EPS) as a partial replacement for coarse aggregate. Test specimens were cast by blending EPS with coarse aggregate at varying proportions of 0%, 15%, 30%, and 45%, while maintaining a constant water-to-binder ratio of 0.60. To enhance the bonding and structural capabilities of the proposed lightweight concrete mixes, reinforcement with 2% and 4% steel fibers by volume of the total concrete mix was incorporated. Silica fume was introduced into the mix to counteract the water hydrophobicity of EPS material and enhance the durability of lightweight concrete, added at a rate of 10% by weight of cement in all specimens. A total of 60 samples, including cylinders and beams, were prepared and cured over 28 days. The physical and mechanical properties of the lightweight EPS-based concrete were systematically examined through experimental testing and compared against a standard concrete mix. The analysis of the results indicates that EPS-based concrete exhibits a controllable low density. It also reveals that incorporating reinforcement materials, such as steel fibers, enhances the overall strength of lightweight concrete.

Electrolyte Optimization Strategy: Enabling Stable and Eco-Friendly Zinc Adaptive Interfacial Layer in Zinc Ion Batteries,"Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) have emerged as a promising battery technology due to their excellent safety, high capacity, low cost, and eco-friendliness. However, the cycle life of AZIBs is limited by severe side reactions and zinc dendrite growth on the zinc electrode surface, hindering large-scale application. Here, an electrolyte optimization strategy utilizing the simplest dipeptide glycylglycine (Gly-Gly) additive is first proposed. Theoretical calculations and spectral analysis revealed that, due to the strong interaction between the amino group and Zn atoms, Gly-Gly preferentially adsorbs on zinc’s surface, constructing a stable and adaptive interfacial layer that inhibits zinc side reactions and dendrite growth. Furthermore, Gly-Gly can regulate zinc ion solvation, leading to a deposition mode shift from dendritic to lamellar and limiting two-dimensional dendrite diffusion. The symmetric cell with the addition of a 20 g/L Gly-Gly additive exhibits a cycle life of up to 1100 h. Under a high current density of 10 mA cm−2, a cycle life of 750 cycles further demonstrates the reliable adaptability of the interfacial layer. This work highlights the potential of Gly-Gly as a promising solution for improving the performance of AZIBs.

Automatic Tracking Based on Weighted Fusion Back Propagation in UWB for IoT Devices,"The global population is progressively entering an aging phase, with population aging likely to emerge as one of the most-significant social trends of the 21st Century, impacting nearly all societal domains. Addressing the challenge of assisting vulnerable groups such as the elderly and disabled in carrying or transporting objects has become a critical issue in this field. We developed a mobile Internet of Things (IoT) device leveraging Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology in this context. This research directly benefits vulnerable groups, including the elderly, disabled individuals, pregnant women, and children. Additionally, it provides valuable references for decision-makers, engineers, and researchers to address real-world challenges. The focus of this research is on implementing UWB technology for precise mobile IoT device localization and following, while integrating an autonomous following system, a robotic arm system, an ultrasonic obstacle-avoidance system, and an automatic leveling control system into a comprehensive experimental platform. To counteract the potential UWB signal fluctuations and high noise interference in complex environments, we propose a hybrid filtering-weighted fusion back propagation (HFWF-BP) neural network localization algorithm. This algorithm combines the characteristics of Gaussian, median, and mean filtering, utilizing a weighted fusion back propagation (WF-BP) neural network, and, ultimately, employs the Chan algorithm to achieve optimal estimation values. Through deployment and experimentation on the device, the proposed algorithm’s data preprocessing effectively eliminates errors under multi-factor interference, significantly enhancing the precision and anti-interference capabilities of the localization and following processes.

Multidimensional 3D-Printed Scaffolds and Regeneration of Intrabony Periodontal Defects: A Systematic Review,"Background: The utilization of regenerative techniques in periodontology involves tailoring tissue engineering principles to suit the oral cavity’s unique environment. Advancements in computer-assisted technology, specifically utilizing cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), enabled the fabrication of 3D-printed scaffolds. The current review aims to explore whether 3D-printed scaffolds are effective in promoting osteogenesis in patients with periodontal defects. Methods: A thorough exploration was undertaken across seven electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Cochrane, Web of Science, Ovid) to detect pertinent research in accordance with specified eligibility criteria, aligning with the PRISMA guidelines. Two independent reviewers undertook the screening and selection of manuscripts, executed data extraction, and evaluated the bias risk using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for non-randomized clinical trials and SYRCLE’s risk of bias tool for animal studies. Results: Initially, 799 articles were identified, refined by removing duplicates. After evaluating 471 articles based on title and abstract, 18 studies remained for full-text assessment. Eventually, merely two manuscripts fulfilled all the eligibility criteria concerning human trials. Both studies were prospective non-randomized clinical trials. Moreover, 11 animal studies were also included. Conclusions: The use of multidimensional, 3D-printed, customized scaffolds appears to stimulate periodontal regeneration. While the reported results are encouraging, additional studies are required to identify the ideal characteristics of the 3D scaffold to be used in the regeneration of periodontal tissue.

The most commonly used inversion method is smooth inversion in which the objective function is built with L2-norm, which has good stability, but it produces non-focused results that make subsequent interpretation difficult. The power-type structural self-constrained inversion (PTSS) method with L2-norm is proposed to improve the resolution of smooth inversion. A self-constraint term based on the power gradient of the results is introduced, which takes advantage of the structural feature that the power gradient can better focus on the model boundary to improve the resolution. For the joint inversion of gravity and magnetic data, the power-type mutual-constrained term between different physical structures and the self-constrained term can be simultaneously used to obtain higher-resolution results. The modeling tests demonstrated that the PTSS method can produce converged high-resolution results with good noise immunity in both the respective inversions and the joint inversion. Then, the PTSS joint inversion was applied to the airborne gravity and magnetic data of the iron ore district in Shandong, revealing the shape and location of the mineralized rock mass, which are crucial information for subsequent detailed exploration.

Chemical Activation of Banana Peel Waste-Derived Biochar Using KOH and Urea for CO2 Capture,"This article describes the synthesis and characterization of porous carbon derived from waste banana peels by chemical activation with KOH or by activation KOH and urea modification. The as-synthesized samples were carefully characterized by various techniques. The prepared carbonaceous materials possess highly developed micropore and mesopore structures and high specific surface area (up to 2795 cm2/g for materials synthetized with KOH and 2718 cm2/g for activated carbons prepared with KOH and urea). A series of KOH-activated samples showed CO2 adsorption at 1 bar to 5.75 mmol/g at 0 °C and 3.74 mmol/g at 25 °C. The incorporation of nitrogen into the carbon sorbent structure increased the carbon uptake capacity of the resulting materials at 1 bar to 6.28 mmol/g and to 3.86 mmol/g at 0 °C and 25 °C, respectively. It was demonstrated that treatment with urea leads to a significant increase in nitrogen content and, consequently, CO2 adsorption, except for the material carbonized at 900 °C. At such a high temperature, almost complete decomposition of urea occurs. The results presented in this work could be used in the future for utilization of biomass such as banana peels as a low-cost adsorbent for CO2 capture, which could have a positive impact on the environment and human health protection.

Atomic-Scale Structural Properties in NiCo2O4/CuFe2O4 Bilayer Heterostructures on (001)-MgAl2O4 Substrate Regulated by Film Thickness,"Changing film thickness to manipulate microstructural properties has been considered as a potential method in practical application. Here, we report that atomic-scale structural properties are regulated by film thickness in an NiCO2O4(NCO)/CuFe2O4(CFO) bilayer heterostructure prepared on (001)-MgAl2O4 (MAO) substrate by means of aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The misfit dislocations at the NCO/CFO interface and antiphase boundaries (APBs) bound to dislocations within the films are both found in NCO (40 nm)/CFO (40 nm)/MAO heterostructures, contributing to the relaxation of mismatch lattice strain. In addition, the non-overlapping a/4[101]-APB is found and the structural transformation of this kind of APB is resolved at the atomic scale. In contrast, only the interfacial dislocations form at the interface without the formation of APBs within the films in NCO (10 nm)/CFO (40 nm)/MAO heterostructures. Our results provide evidence that the formation of microstructural defects can be regulated by changing film thickness to tune the magnetic properties of epitaxial bilayer spinel oxide films.

Resilient Strategies for Internet-Based Education: Investigating Engineering Students in the Canary Islands in the Aftermath of COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about notable changes in the education sector, specifically the shift towards online learning. This study examined the experiences of 124 engineering students in the Canary Islands, an EU ultra-peripheral region, as they adapted to online education during the pandemic. A comprehensive survey assessed students’ experiences in five key dimensions, including satisfaction with traditional face-to-face learning, perceptions of the engineering department’s transition to online learning, module-specific adaptations, personal adaptation strategies, and the adaptation of teaching staff. The study’s methodology involved statistical analyses using Microsoft Excel v16.0 and SPSS 27 tools to identify patterns and draw conclusions. The findings indicate a nuanced landscape. Students demonstrated strong technological literacy and readiness for online learning. However, they expressed concerns about educators’ digital proficiency and perceived a decline in educational quality. These results emphasize the critical need for sustainable, adaptable, and inclusive educational strategies, particularly in regions like the Canary Islands that face unique challenges. The implications of the study have broader relevance to digital education. It is essential to note the need for educators to receive comprehensive training in digital tools and methodologies to improve the quality of online learning.

Thermodynamics of Iron Ammonia Synthesis Catalyst Sintering,"The sintering of iron ammonia synthesis catalysts (nanocrystalline iron promoted with: Al2O3, CaO and K2O) was studied under a hydrogen atmosphere, in a temperature range of 773 to 973 K to obtain stationary states. The catalysts were characterized by measuring the nitriding reaction rate under an ammonia atmosphere at 748 K to obtain steady states and the measurement of specific surface area. Chemical processes were conducted in a tubular differential reactor enabling thermogravimetric measurements and the chemical composition analysis of a gas phase under conditions allowing experiments to be carried out in the kinetic region of chemical reactions. An extended model of the active surface of the iron ammonia synthesis catalyst was presented, taking into account the influence of the gas phase composition and process temperature. The surface of iron nanocrystallites was wetted using promoters in an exothermic process associated with the formation of the surface Fes-O- bond and the change in the surface energy of iron nanocrystallites. Promoters formed on the surface of iron nanocrystallites with different structures of chemisorbed dipoles, depending on the composition of the gas phase. The occupied sites stabilized the structure, and the free sites were active sites in the process of adsorption of chemical reagents and in sintering. Based on the bonding energy of the promoter oxides and the difference in surface energy between the covered and uncovered surfaces, the wetting abilities of promoters, which can be arranged according to the order K2O > Fe3O4 > Al2O3 > CaO, were estimated. By increasing the temperature in the endothermic sintering process, the degree of surface coverage with dipoles of promoters decreased, and thus the catalyst underwent sintering. The size distribution of nanocrystallites did not change with decreasing temperature. Only the equilibrium between the glass phase and the surface of iron nanocrystallites was then established.

Optimization of Financial Indicators in Shale-Gas Wells Combining Numerical Decline Curve Analysis and Economic Data Analysis,"We present a methodology to determine optimal financial parameters in shale-gas production, combining numerical simulation of decline curves and stochastic modeling of the gas price. The mathematical model of gas production considers free gas in the pore and the gas adsorbed in kerogen. The dependence of gas production on petrophysical parameters and stimulated permeability is quantified by solving the model equations in a 3D geometry representing a typical fractured shale well. We use Monte Carlo simulation to characterize the statistical properties of various common financial indicators of the investment in shale-gas. The analysis combines many realizations of the physical model, which explores the variability of porosity, induced permeability, and fracture geometry, with thousands of realizations of gas price trajectories. The evolution of gas prices is modeled using the bootstrapping statistical resampling technique to obtain a probability density function of the initial price, the drift, and the volatility of a geometric Brownian motion for the time evolution of gas price. We analyze the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Discounted Payback Period (DPP) indicators. By computing the probability density function of each indicator, we characterize the statistical percentile of each value of the indicator. Alternatively, we can infer the value of the indicator for a given statistical percentile. By mapping these parametric combinations for different indicators, we can determine the parameters that maximize or minimize each of them. We show that, to achieve a profitable investment in shale-gas with high certainty, it is necessary to place the wells in extremely good locations in terms of geological parameters (porosity) and to have exceptional fracturing technology (geometry) and fracture permeability. These high demands in terms of petrophysical properties and hydrofracture engineering may explain the industry observation of “sweet spots”, that is, specific areas within shale-gas plays that tend to yield more profitable wells and where many operators concentrate their production. We shed light on the rational origin of this phenomenon: while shale formations are abundant, areas prone to having a multi-parameter combination that renders the well profitable are less common.

Digital Twin Prototypes for Supporting Automated Integration Testing of Smart Farming Applications,"Industry 4.0 marks a major technological shift, revolutionizing manufacturing with increased efficiency, productivity, and sustainability. This transformation is paralleled in agriculture through smart farming, employing similar advanced technologies to enhance agricultural practices. Both fields demonstrate a symmetry in their technological approaches. Recent advancements in software engineering and the digital twin paradigm are addressing the challenge of creating embedded software systems for these technologies. Digital twins allow full development of software systems before physical prototypes are made, exemplifying a cost-effective method for Industry 4.0 software development. Our digital twin prototype approach mirrors software operations within a virtual environment, integrating all sensor interfaces to ensure accuracy between emulated and real hardware. In essence, the digital twin prototype acts as a prototype of its physical counterpart, effectively substituting it for automated testing of physical twin software. This paper discusses a case study applying this approach to smart farming, specifically enhancing silage production. We also provide a lab study for independent replication of this approach. The source code for a digital twin prototype of a PiCar-X by SunFounder is available open-source on GitHub, illustrating how digital twins can bridge the gap between virtual simulations and physical operations, highlighting the symmetry between physical and digital twins.

Flame Spray Pyrolysis Synthesis of Vo-Rich Nano-SrTiO3-x,"Engineering of oxygen vacancies (Vo) in nanomaterials allows diligent control of their physicochemical properties. SrTiO3 possesses the typical ABO3 structure and has attracted considerable attention among the titanates due to its chemical stability and its high conduction band energy. This has resulted in its extensive use in photocatalytic energy-related processes, among others. Herein, we introduce the use of Flame Spray Pyrolysis (FSP); an industrial and scalable process to produce Vo-rich SrTiO3 perovskites. We present two types of Anoxic Flame Spray Pyrolysis (A-FSP) technologies using CH4 gas as a reducing source: Radial A-FSP (RA-FSP); and Axial A-FSP (AA-FSP). These are used for the control engineering of oxygen vacancies in the SrTiO3-x nanolattice. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman and thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis, we discuss the role and the amount of the Vos in the so-produced nano-SrTiO3-x, correlating the properties of the nanolattice and energy-band structure of the SrTiO3-x. The present work further corroborates the versatility of FSP as a synthetic process and the potential future application of this process to engineer photocatalysts with oxygen vacancies in quantities that can be measured in kilograms.

Complete Chloroplast Genomes of Four Oaks from the Section Cyclobalanopsis Improve the Phylogenetic Analysis and Understanding of Evolutionary Processes in the Genus Quercus,"Quercus is a valuable genus ecologically, economically, and culturally. They are keystone species in many ecosystems. Species delimitation and phylogenetic studies of this genus are difficult owing to frequent hybridization. With an increasing number of genetic resources, we will gain a deeper understanding of this genus. In the present study, we collected four Quercus section Cyclobalanopsis species (Q. poilanei, Q. helferiana, Q. camusiae, and Q. semiserrata) distributed in Southeast Asia and sequenced their complete genomes. Following analysis, we compared the results with those of other species in the genus Quercus. These four chloroplast genomes ranged from 160,784 bp (Q. poilanei) to 161,632 bp (Q. camusiae) in length, with an overall guanine and cytosine (GC) content of 36.9%. Their chloroplast genomic organization and order, as well as their GC content, were similar to those of other Quercus species. We identified seven regions with relatively high variability (rps16, ndhk, accD, ycf1, psbZ—trnG-GCC, rbcL—accD, and rpl32—trnL-UAG) which could potentially serve as plastid markers for further taxonomic and phylogenetic studies within Quercus. Our phylogenetic tree supported the idea that the genus Quercus forms two well-differentiated lineages (corresponding to the subgenera Quercus and Cerris). Of the three sections in the subgenus Cerris, the section Ilex was split into two clusters, each nested in the other two sections. Moreover, Q. camusiae and Q. semiserrata detected in this study diverged first in the section Cyclobalanopsis and mixed with Q. engleriana in the section Ilex. In particular, 11 protein coding genes (atpF, ndhA, ndhD, ndhF, ndhK, petB, petD, rbcL, rpl22, ycf1, and ycf3) were subjected to positive selection pressure. Overall, this study enriches the chloroplast genome resources of Quercus, which will facilitate further analyses of phylogenetic relationships in this ecologically important tree genus.

Geospatial Analysis of Wind Energy Siting Suitability in the East African Community,"Site investigation is essential for developing and constructing a dependable and effective wind engineering project. Also, the kinetic energy of moving air, used to drive a wind turbine, produces electricity. Having seen the shortage of previous studies on wind energy sites’ suitability across Africa and having read about the abundance of untapped wind energy resources in the East African region, this paper used Geographical Information System (GIS), multi-criteria, and Analytic Hierarchy techniques to provide a geospatial analysis of wind energy technology siting suitability in Eastern African Community Countries. Different data were acquired and processed from numerous open-access databases (Global Wind atlas, Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD), African Geoportal, East African community website, and Energy data Info.org). The results reveal Kenya has large parts of its land areas highly appropriate for wind energy siting (15.26%) and 1.55% of its land classified as unsuitable for wind energy generation. The rates of suitability and unsuitability were respectively 26.57% and 4.87% for Burundi, 20.6% and 10.21% for Rwanda, 20.39% and 10.44% for Tanzania, and 4.65% and 27.15% for South Sudan. The findings also show that East Africa exhibits moderate levels of wind energy siting suitability, with an estimated average of around 37.27% of its land area moderately suitable for wind energy technology installation, covering thousands of square kilometers. The study is advantageous to academia and industry-related personnel engaged in renewable energy-related activities in other African countries with similar topographies.

Dependence of Nucleation Field on the Size of Soft Phase in Magnetic Hard–Soft Exchange Coupling Nanocomposites,"Hard–soft exchange coupling nanocomposites have critical applications in various important materials. The magnetic properties of nanocomposite permanent magnetic films improve with a higher nucleation field (Hns) of the soft magnetic phase. Hns is sensitive to the thickness (ds) of the soft magnetic layer. Understanding the dependence of Hns and irreversible field (Hirr) on ds, especially at the nanometric scale, is crucial for comprehending the magnetic mechanism and facilitating the design and preparation of high-performance nanocomposite permanent magnets. However, during the high-temperature deposition process, diffusion between hard and soft magnetic phases occurs, leading to the generation of other phases. This makes it challenging to accurately reflect the relationship between Hns and ds. To address this issue, we successfully fabricated high-quality SmCo5/Fe nanocomposite bilayer films with different soft magnetic thicknesses and high textures by controlling the preparation process. We conducted a quantitative analysis of the relationship between Hns and ds within the range of 2–40 nm. Based on the experimental results, we propose a new theoretical simulation formula that enhances the understanding of the characteristics at the interface between the soft magnetic and hard magnetic phases. The theoretical simulation results show that a thin softened hard layer of about 4–6 nm thickness exists at the interfacial region, which concurrently reverses with the soft magnetic phase during the demagnetization process. Our results offer the generality and critical basis for the further study of hard–soft nanocomposite magnetic materials.

The Future of Permanent-Magnet-Based Electric Motors: How Will Rare Earths Affect Electrification?,"In this review article, we focus on the relationship between permanent magnets and the electric motor, as this relationship has not been covered in a review paper before. With the increasing focus on battery research, other parts of the electric system have been neglected. To make electrification a smooth transition, as has been promised by governing bodies, we need to understand and improve the electric motor and its main component, the magnet. Today’s review papers cover only the engineering perspective of the electric motor or the material-science perspective of the magnetic material, but not both together, which is a crucial part of understanding the needs of electric-motor design and the possibilities that a magnet can give them. We review the road that leads to today’s state-of-the-art in electric motors and magnet design and give possible future roads to tackle the obstacles ahead and reach the goals of a fully electric transportation system. With new technologies now available, like additive manufacturing and artificial intelligence, electric motor designers have not yet exploited the possibilities the new freedom of design brings. New out-of-the-box designs will have to emerge to realize the full potential of the new technology. We also focus on the rare-earth crisis and how future price fluctuations can be avoided. Recycling plays a huge role in this, and developing a self-sustained circular economy will be critical, but the road to it is still very steep, as ongoing projects show.

Base Study of Bridge Inspection by Modeling Touch Information Using Light Detection and Ranging,"In Japan, bridges are inspected via close visual examinations every five years. However, these inspections are labor intensive, and a shortage of engineers and budget constraints will restrict such inspections in the future. In recent years, efforts have been made to reduce the labor required for inspections by automating various aspects of the inspection process. In this study, we proposed and evaluated a method of applying super-resolution technology to obtain precise point cloud information to create distance information images to enable the use of tactile information (e.g., human touch) on the surface to be inspected. We measured the distance to the specimen using LiDAR, generated distance information images, performed super-resolution on the pseudo-created low-resolution images, and evaluated them in comparison with the existing magnification method. The evaluation results suggest that the adaptation of the super-resolution technique is effective in increasing the resolution of the boundary of the distance change.

Numerical Simulation and Environmental Impact Assessment of VOCs Diffusion Based on Multi-Emission Sources in the Natural Gas Purification Plant,"The rising number of natural gas purification plants has raised concerns about safety and environmental issues related to VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) leakage. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct in-depth research on oil vapor emission patterns in these plants. Taking a typical natural gas purification plant as an example, a 1:1 scale model was established. Using methanol as the simulated medium, a study was conducted to investigate the impact of multiple leaks on the dispersion process of VOCs at the plant, combining field sampling with numerical simulation. The results indicate that wind speed influences the concentration of oil vapor, particularly on the leeward side, where vortex and reflux phenomena occur. The area of high concentration of oil vapor at v = 4 m·s−1 is eight times that at v = 8 m·s−1. Gravity and eddy currents contribute to the accumulation of oil vapor, especially closer to the central area of the plant where surrounding buildings obstruct dispersion. Smaller distances between leakage sources result in higher concentrations of oil vapor in the central region, leading to a larger affected area in the event of an accident. The study holds significant practical significance for the research, prevention, and management of leakage and dispersion incidents.

Topographically and Chemically Enhanced Textile Polycaprolactone Scaffolds for Tendon and Ligament Tissue Engineering,"The use of tissue engineering to address the shortcomings of current procedures for tendons and ligaments is promising, but it requires a suitable scaffold that meets various mechanical, degradation-related, scalability-related, and biological requirements. Macroporous textile scaffolds made from appropriate fiber material have the potential to fulfill the first three requirements. This study aimed to investigate the biocompatibility, sterilizability, and functionalizability of a multilayer braided scaffold. These macroporous scaffolds with dimensions similar to those of the human anterior cruciate ligament consist of fibers with appropriate tensile strength and degradation behavior melt-spun from Polycaprolactone (PCL). Two different cross-sectional geometries resulting in significantly different specific surface areas and morphologies were used at the fiber level, and a Chitosan-graft-PCL (CS-g-PCL) surface modification was applied to the melt-spun substrates for the first time. All scaffolds elicited a positive cell response, and the CS-g-PCL modification provided a platform for incorporating functionalization agents such as drug delivery systems for growth factors, which were successfully released in therapeutically effective quantities. The fiber geometry was found to be a variable that could be manipulated to control the amount released. Therefore, scaled, surface-modified textile scaffolds are a versatile technology that can successfully address the complex requirements of tissue engineering for ligaments and tendons, as well as other structures.

Comparative Analysis between Intelligent Machine Committees and Hybrid Deep Learning with Genetic Algorithms in Energy Sector Forecasting: A Case Study on Electricity Price and Wind Speed in the Brazilian Market,"Global environmental impacts such as climate change require behavior from society that aims to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. This includes the substitution of fossil fuels with other energy sources. An important aspect of efficient and sustainable management of the electricity supply in Brazil is the prediction of some variables of the national electric system (NES), such as the price of differences settlement (PLD) and wind speed for wind energy. In this context, the present study investigated two distinct forecasting approaches. The first involved the combination of deep artificial neural network techniques, long short-term memory (LSTM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), optimized through the canonical genetic algorithm (GA). The second approach focused on machine committees including MLP, decision tree, linear regression, and support vector machine (SVM) in one committee, and MLP, LSTM, SVM, and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) in another. The results indicate that the hybrid AG + LSTM algorithm demonstrated the best performance for PLD, with a mean squared error (MSE) of 4.68. For wind speed, there is a MSE of 1.26. These solutions aim to contribute to the Brazilian electricity market’s decision making.

"Spatial–Temporal Water Balance Evaluation in the Nile Valley Upstream of the New Assiut Barrage, Egypt, Using WetSpass-M","The components of water balance (WBC) that involve precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, irrigation, and groundwater recharge are critical for understanding the hydrological cycle and water management of resources in semi-arid and arid areas. This paper assesses temporal and spatial distributions of surface runoff, actual evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge upstream of the New Assiut Barrage (NAB) in the Nile Valley, Upper Egypt, using the WetSpass-M model for the period 2012–2020. Moreover, this study evaluates the effect of land cover/land use (LULC) alterations in the study period on the WBC of the NAB. The data provided as input for the WetSpass-M model in the structure of raster maps using the Arc-GIS tool. Monthly meteorological factors (e.g., temperature, rainfall, and wind speed), a digital elevation model (DEM), slope, land cover, irrigation cover, a soil map, and depth to groundwater are included. The long-term temporal and spatial mean monthly irrigation and precipitation (127 mm) is distributed as 49% (62 mm) actual evapotranspiration, 15% (19 mm) groundwater recharge, and 36% (46 mm) surface runoff. The replacement of cropland by built-up areas was recognized as the primary factor responsible for the major decrease in groundwater, an increase in evapotranspiration and an increase in surface runoff between LCLU in 2012 and 2020. The integration of the WetSpass model with GIS has shown its effectiveness as a powerful approach for assessing WBC. Results were more accurate and reliable when hydrological modeling and spatial analysis were combined. The results of this research can help make well-informed decisions about land use planning and sustainable management of water resources in the upstream area of the NAB.

Active Compensation Technology for the Target Measurement Error of Two-Axis Electro-Optical Measurement Equipment,"For two-axis electro-optical measurement equipment, there are many error sources in parts manufacturing, assembly, sensors, calibration, and so on, which cause some random errors in the final measurement results of the target. In order to eliminate the random measurement error as much as possible and improve the measurement accuracy, an active compensation technique for target measurement error is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the error formation mechanism and error transfer model establishment of the two-axis electro-optical measurement equipment were studied, and based on that, three error compensation and correction methods were proposed: the least square (LS)-based error compensation method, adaptive Kalman filter(AKF)-based error correction method, and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)-based error compensation method. According to the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation comparison, the proposed RBFNN-based error compensation method was identified as the optimal error compensation method, which can approximate the random error space surface more precisely, so that a more accurate error compensation value can be obtained, and in order to improve the measurement accuracy with higher precision. Finally, the experimental results proved that the proposed active compensation technology was valid in engineering applicability and could efficiently enhance the measurement accuracy of the two-axis electro-optical measurement equipment.

Non-Destructive Evaluation of the Physiochemical Properties of Milk Drink Flavored with Date Syrup Utilizing VIS-NIR Spectroscopy and ANN Analysis,"A milk drink flavored with date syrup produced at a lab scale level was evaluated. The production process of date syrup involves a sequence of essential unit operations, commencing with the extraction, filtration, and concentration processes from two cultivars: Sukkary and Khlass. Date syrup was then mixed with cow’s and camel’s milk at four percentages to form a nutritious, natural, sweet, and energy-rich milk drink. The sensory, physical, and chemical characteristics of the milk drinks flavored with date syrup were examined. The objective of this work was to measure the physiochemical properties of date fruits and milk drinks flavored with date syrup, and then to evaluate the physical properties of milk drinks utilizing non-destructive visible–near-infrared spectra (VIS-NIR). The study assessed the characteristics of the milk drink enhanced with date syrup by employing VIS-NIR spectra and utilizing a partial least-square regression (PLSR) and artificial neural network (ANN) analysis. The VIS-NIR spectra proved to be highly effective in estimating the physiochemical attributes of the flavored milk drink. The ANN model outperformed the PLSR model in this context. RMSECV is considered a more reliable indicator of a model’s future predictive performance compared to RMSEC, and the R2 value ranged between 0.946 and 0.989. Consequently, non-destructive VIS-NIR technology demonstrates significant promise for accurately predicting and contributing to the entire production process of the product’s properties examined.

The Influence of TiO2–Lignin Hybrid Fillers in Low-Density Polyethylene Composites on Photocatalytic Performance and UV-Barrier Properties,"The main objective of this study was to discover new packaging materials that could integrate one of the most expected properties, such as UV protection, with a self-cleaning ability defined as photocatalytic performance. Accordingly, new hybrid additives were used to transform LDPE films into materials with complex performance properties. In this study, titanium dioxide–lignin (TL) hybrid systems with a weight ratio of inorganic to organic precursors of 5-1, 1-1, and 1-5 were prepared using a mechanical method. The obtained materials and pristine components were characterized using measurement techniques and research methods, such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal stability analysis (TGA/DTG), measurement of the electrokinetic potential as a function of pH, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and particle size distribution measurement. It was found that hydrogen bonds were formed between the organic and inorganic components, based on which the obtained systems were classified as class I hybrid materials. In the next step, inorganic–organic hybrid systems and pristine components were used as fillers for a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) composite, 5 and 10% by weight, in order to determine their impact on parameters such as tensile elongation at break. Polymer composites containing titanium dioxide in their matrix were then subjected to a test of photocatalytic properties, based on which it was found that all materials with TiO2 in their structure exhibit photocatalytic properties, whereby the best results were obtained for samples containing the TiO2–lignin hybrid system (1-1). The mechanical tests showed that the thin sheet films had a strong anisotropy due to chill-roll extrusion, ranging from 1.98 to 3.32. UV–Vis spectroscopy revealed four times higher light absorption for composites in which lignin was present than for pure LDPE, in the 250–450 nm range. On the other hand, the temperature at 5% and 30% weight loss revealed by TGA testing increased the highest performance for LDPE/TiO2 materials (by 20.4 °C and 8.7 °C, respectively).

Revealing the Supply Chain 4.0 Potential within the European Automotive Industry,"With the rapid advancements in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and the widespread enthusiasm of both theoreticians and practitioners, the broader transition to Industry 4.0 (I4.0) in major industries appears imminent. This empirical study analyzes business data from 1140 automotive companies operating in Europe, utilizing various business intelligence platforms and employing decision tree analytics to establish connections between enablers, drivers, company size, and financial resources. The goal is to identify persistent barriers hindering the rational transition to Industry 4.0. The findings reveal an uneven transformation within the industry nexus. While larger companies possess the financial means to allocate collective intelligence, technical resources, and drive necessary for fulfilling I4.0 requirements, smaller members of the nexus lag behind despite their enthusiasm and intent. This imbalanced evolution poses a threat to the comprehensive transformation required for realizing all the benefits of Industry 4.0 within the sector. The primary discovery indicates that small to medium-sized enterprises do not exhibit the same rates of Industry 4.0 adoption, a lag highly correlated with their available financial and human resources for digital transition. The decision tree proposed in this study offers guidelines for achieving an Industry 4.0-compliant nexus. Given its diversity and substantial global impact, the case study from the automotive industry proves intriguing and may later be generalized to other sectors.

Study of Synthesis of Dual-Curing Thermoplastic Polyurethane Hot-Melt Adhesive and Optimization by Using Gray Relational Analysis to Apply in Fabric Industry to Solve Seamless Bonding Issues,"People wear clothes for warmth, survival and necessity in modern life, but in the modern era, eco-friendliness, shortened production times, design and intelligence also matter. To determine the relationship between data series and verify the proximity of each data series, a gray relational analysis, or GRA, is applied to textiles, where seamless bonding technology enhances the bond between components. In this study, a polyurethane prepolymer, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (2-HEA) as an end-capping agent and n-octyl acrylate (ODA) as a photoinitiator were used to synthesize a dual-curing polyurethane hot-melt adhesive. Taguchi quality engineering and a gray relational analysis were used to discuss the influence of different mole ratios of NCO:OH and the effect of the molar ratio of the addition of octyl decyl acrylate on the mechanical strength. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results showed the termination of the prepolymer’s polymerization reaction and the C=O peak intensity at 1730 cm−1, indicating efficient bonding to the main chain. Advanced Polymer Chromatography (APC) was used to investigate the high-molecular-weight (20,000–30,000) polyurethane polymer bonded with octyl decyl acrylate to achieve a photothermosetting effect. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results showed that the thermal decomposition temperature of the polyurethane hot-melt adhesive also increased, and they showed the highest pyrolysis temperature (349.89 °C) for the polyhydric alcohols. Furthermore, high peel strength (1.68 kg/cm) and shear strength (34.94 kg/cm2) values were detected with the dual-cure photothermosetting polyurethane hot-melt adhesive. The signal-to-noise ratio was also used to generate the gray relational degree. It was observed that the best parameter ratio of NCO:OH was 4:1 with five moles of monomer. The Taguchi quality engineering method was used to find the parameters of single-quality optimization, and then the gray relation calculation was used to obtain the parameter combination of multi-quality optimization for thermosetting the polyurethane hot-melt adhesive. The study aims to meet the requirements of seamless bonding in textile factories and optimize experimental parameter design by setting target values that can effectively increase production speed and reduce processing time and costs as well.

On Conformable Fractional Milne-Type Inequalities,"Building upon previous research in conformable fractional calculus, this study introduces a novel identity. Using this identity as a foundation, we derive a set of conformable fractional Milne-type inequalities specifically designed for differentiable convex functions. The obtained results recover some existing inequalities in the literature by fixing some parameters. These novel contributions aim to enrich the analytical tools available for studying convex functions within the realm of conformable fractional calculus. The derived inequalities reflect an inherent symmetry characteristic of the Milne formula, further illustrating the balanced and harmonious mathematical structure within these frameworks. We provide a thorough example with graphical representations to support our findings, offering both numerical insights and visual confirmation of the established inequalities.

IFGAN—A Novel Image Fusion Model to Fuse 3D Point Cloud Sensory Data,"To enhance the level of autonomy in driving, it is crucial to ensure optimal execution of critical maneuvers in all situations. However, numerous accidents involving autonomous vehicles (AVs) developed by major automobile manufacturers in recent years have been attributed to poor decision making caused by insufficient perception of environmental information. AVs employ diverse sensors in today’s technology-driven settings to gather this information. However, due to technical and natural factors, the data collected by these sensors may be incomplete or ambiguous, leading to misinterpretation by AVs and resulting in fatal accidents. Furthermore, environmental information obtained from multiple sources in the vehicular environment often exhibits multimodal characteristics. To address this limitation, effective preprocessing of raw sensory data becomes essential, involving two crucial tasks: data cleaning and data fusion. In this context, we propose a comprehensive data fusion engine that categorizes various sensory data formats and appropriately merges them to enhance accuracy. Specifically, we suggest a general framework to combine audio, visual, and textual data, building upon our previous research on an innovative hybrid image fusion model that fused multispectral image data. However, this previous model faced challenges when fusing 3D point cloud data and handling large volumes of sensory data. To overcome these challenges, our study introduces a novel image fusion model called Image Fusion Generative Adversarial Network (IFGAN), which incorporates a multi-scale attention mechanism into both the generator and discriminator of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The primary objective of image fusion is to merge complementary data from various perspectives of the same scene to enhance the clarity and detail of the final image. The multi-scale attention mechanism serves two purposes: the first, capturing comprehensive spatial information to enable the generator to focus on foreground and background target information in the sensory data, and the second, constraining the discriminator to concentrate on attention regions rather than the entire input image. Furthermore, the proposed model integrates the color information retention concept from the previously proposed image fusion model. Furthermore, we propose simple and efficient models for extracting salient image features. We evaluate the proposed models using various standard metrics and compare them with existing popular models. The results demonstrate that our proposed image fusion model outperforms the other models in terms of performance.

Effect of Glucose Concentration on the Production of Proteolytic Extract by Different Strains of Aspergillus under Solid-State Fermentation,"Proteases are important enzymes because of their extended uses in several industries, such as food, beverages, pharmacy, detergents, and many others. Aspergillus is one of the most used fungi strains for enzyme production by solid-state fermentation (SSF). Disponibility of the carbon source is a key factor for protease production. In addition, the selection of solid support has great importance, as it must provide suitable airflow through the packed bed and nutrient diffusion inside the fermentable mass. Six Aspergillus strains and two inert supports (Agrolite (AL) and Polyurethane (PUF)) were tested for protease production from fish flour (FF) at different glucose concentrations (0, 5, 10, 15%) by SSF. The FF/PUF mixture at 70/30 (w/w) ratio, with 75.39% moisture, and a critical moisture point of 0.11 gH2O/g, presented a texture that allowed heat and mass transfer and provided enough moisture to make free water available as required for microorganism growth during the fermentation process. Aspergillus oryzae 2095 produced higher amounts of neutral and alkaline proteases with the addition of 5% glucose to the growth medium. Kinetics studies reveal that protease production is partially associated with growth. The extracts obtained can be used in different industries, and especially to prepare fish high-value by-product hydrolysates.

Li is an important supplement to traditional strategic metal mineral resources and has become an important avenue of mineral resource exploration. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish a cooperative exploration model of coal and Li deposits to lay a theoretical foundation from the perspective of technical optimization and economic rationality. This study is based on the distribution characteristics of the Haerwusu coal–Li deposit, and the effectiveness of the response to exploration techniques, the economical and effective exploration techniques, the reasonable exploration engineering design, and resource estimation parameters is investigated. Therefore, the cooperative exploration model of the coal–Li deposit is established. The high-Li areas in the surface of the Haerwusu Li deposit is distributed near the B1 anticline or in the middle area between the X1 syncline and the B1 anticline, and the vertical distribution of Li content is irregular. The exploration techniques, exploration engineering design, and resource estimation are reviewed and optimized. According to the geological, geochemical, and geophysical conditions, a reasonable cooperative exploration model for coal–Li deposits is established from the two aspects of the coordination of multi-mineral exploration and the coordination of various exploration technologies. The determination of the coal–Li deposit cooperative exploration model has important practical significance for improving the resource security system.

The Complexity of Colour/Textile Interaction in Digital Printing as an Integral Part of Environmental Design,"Textile materials are an essential part of contemporary architecture, the environment, and urban spaces due to their unique appearance and qualities, as it is now possible to achieve both a structural function and an aesthetic quality with textiles. As colour is one of the most important characteristics of textile material, it is also important to understand the relationships between colour and textile material with different surface qualities. In order to explain the complexity of different textile materials and the appearance of colours, which consequently affects the colour properties, this paper analyses this phenomenon. The presented research analyses the dependence of the reproduction quality and colour appearance on fabrics of different construction and structural characteristics, i.e., the texture of the textile material, printed using digital inkjet technology. The aim of this work is to investigate the influence of various structural features of textiles on the colour appearance of digitally printed textile substrates, to monitor the quality of colour reproduction, and to analyse the behaviour of a reactive dye droplet on textile substrates. Printing of a particular shape was performed using a Dimatix Materials Printer DMP-2831 piezoelectric inkjet device (provided by the J. Stefan Institute, Ljubjana, Slovenia; manufactured by Fujifilm Dimatix Inc., 2230 Martin Avenue, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The behaviour of the ink delivered by the needle of the tensiometer DSA20E, Kruess GmbH (provided by the J. Stefan Institute, Ljubjana, Slovenia; manufactured by Kruess Scientific Instruments (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. Futong Dong Dajie 10 Baoneng Center, Tower B, Room 605 Chaoyang District, Beijing 100102, China), on the surface of the fabric was analysed. The samples were digitally printed on a Mimaki digital printer Tx2-1600 (provided by University of Ljubljana Faculty of Natural Science and Engineering, Slovenia EU; manufactured by Mimaki, 2182-3 Shigeno-Otsu, Tomi-city, Nagano, Japan), with reactive dyes, which were first pretreated in a bath with a specific solution. The statistical method of image analysis and microscopic imaging were used to obtain the characteristics of the porosity, texture, and roughness parameters. All results are presented from colouristic analysis based on the objectification of colour and colour differences. The objective values of the parameters of lightness (L*), chroma (C*), and hue (h°) show the significant influence of the structure and properties of the substrate on colour reproduction, and significant changes were obtained, which were confirmed by the evaluation of the colour differences. The results confirm the influence of the substrate structure on colour properties. Furthermore, it is essential to consider this complexity in the context of environmental colour design when utilising (coloured) textile installations/materials in architecture and urban spaces, i.e., in the environment.

3D Printing of Biodegradable Polymeric Microneedles for Transdermal Drug Delivery Applications,"Microneedle (MN) technology is an optimal choice for the delivery of drugs via the transdermal route, with a minimally invasive procedure. MN applications are varied from drug delivery, cosmetics, tissue engineering, vaccine delivery, and disease diagnostics. The MN is a biomedical device that offers many advantages including but not limited to a painless experience, being time-effective, and real-time sensing. This research implements additive manufacturing (AM) technology to fabricate MN arrays for advanced therapeutic applications. Stereolithography (SLA) was used to fabricate six MN designs with three aspect ratios. The MN array included conical-shaped 100 needles (10 × 10 needle) in each array. The microneedles were characterized using optical and scanning electron microscopy to evaluate the dimensional accuracy. Further, mechanical and insertion tests were performed to analyze the mechanical strength and skin penetration capabilities of the polymeric MN. MNs with higher aspect ratios had higher deformation characteristics suitable for penetration to deeper levels beyond the stratum corneum. MNs with both 0.3 mm and 0.4 mm base diameters displayed consistent force–displacement behavior during a skin-equivalent penetration test. This research establishes guidelines for fabricating polymeric MN for high-accuracy and low-cost 3D printing.

Risk Assessment and Analysis of Rock Burst under High-Temperature Liquid Nitrogen Cooling,"Rock burst, an important kind of geological disaster, often occurs in underground construction. Rock burst risk assessment, as an important part of engineering risk assessment, cannot be ignored. Liquid nitrogen fracturing is a new technology used in the geological, oil, and gas industries to enhance productivity. It involves injecting liquid nitrogen into reservoir rocks to induce fractures and increase permeability, effectively reducing rock burst occurrences and facilitating the flow of oil or gas toward the wellbore. The research on rock burst risk assessment technology is the basis of reducing rock burst geological disasters, which has important theoretical and practical significance. This article examines the temperature treatment of two types of rocks at 25 °C, 100 °C, 200 °C, 300 °C, and 400 °C, followed by immersion in a liquid nitrogen tank. The temperature difference between the liquid nitrogen and the rocks may trigger rock bursting. The research focused on analyzing various characteristics of rock samples when exposed to liquid nitrogen. This included studying the stress–strain curve, elastic modulus, strength, cross-section analysis, wave velocity, and other relevant aspects. Under the influence of high temperature and a liquid nitrogen jet, the wave velocity of rocks often changes. The structural characteristics and possible hidden dangers of rocks can be understood more comprehensively through section scanning analysis. The stress–strain curve describes the deformation and failure behavior of rocks under different stress levels, which can help to evaluate their stability and structural performance. The investigation specifically focused on the behavior of rocks subjected to high temperatures and liquid nitrogen. By analyzing the stress–strain curves, researchers were able to identify the precursors and deformation processes that occur before significant deformation or failure. These findings have implications for the mechanical properties and stability of the rocks.

Hybrid-Aligned Fibers of Electrospun Gelatin with Antibiotic and Polycaprolactone Composite Membranes as an In Vitro Drug Delivery System to Assess the Potential Repair Capacity of Damaged Cornea,"The cornea lacks the ability to repair itself and must rely on transplantation to repair damaged tissue. Therefore, creating alternative therapies using dressing membranes based on tissue engineering concepts to repair corneal damage before failure has become a major research goal. Themost outstanding features that are important in reconstructing a damaged cornea are the mechanical strength and transparency of the membrane, which are the most important standard considerations. In addition, preventing infection is an important issue, especially in corneal endothelial healing processes. The purpose of this study was to produce aligned fibers via electrospinning technology using gelatin (Gel) composite polycaprolactone (PCL) as an optimal transport and antibiotic release membrane. The aim of the composite membrane is to achieve good tenacity, transparency, antibacterial properties, and in vitro biocompatibility. Results showed that the Gel and PCL composite membranes with the same electrospinning flow rate had the best transparency. The Gel impregnated with gentamicin antibiotic in composite membranes subsequently exhibited transparency and enhanced mechanical properties provided by PCL and could sustainably release the antibiotic for 48 h, achieving good antibacterial effects without causing cytotoxicity. This newly developed membrane has the advantage of preventing epidermal tissue infection during clinical operations and is expected to be used in the reconstruction of damaged cornea in the future.

Joint Entity and Relation Extraction Model Based on Inner and Outer Tensor Dot Product and Single-Table Filling,"Joint relational triple extraction is a crucial step in constructing a knowledge graph from unstructured text. Recently, multiple methods have been proposed for extracting relationship triplets. Notably, end-to-end table-filling methods have garnered significant research interest due to their efficient extraction capabilities. However, existing approaches usually generate separate tables for each relationship, which neglects the global correlation between relationships and context, producing a large number of useless blank tables. This problem results in issues of redundant information and sample imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for joint entity and relation extraction based on a single-table filling method. This method incorporates all relationships as prompts within the text sequence and associates entity span information with relationship labels. This approach reduces the generation of redundant information and enhances the extraction capability for overlapping triplets. We utilize the internal and external multi-head tensor fusion approach to generate two sets of table feature vectors. These vectors are subsequently merged to capture a wider range of global information. Experimental results on the NYT and WebNLG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, which maintains excellent performance, even in complex scenarios involving overlapping triplets.

Calcium Phosphate Biomaterials for 3D Bioprinting in Bone Tissue Engineering,"Three-dimensional bioprinting is a promising technology for bone tissue engineering. However, most hydrogel bioinks lack the mechanical and post-printing fidelity properties suitable for such hard tissue regeneration. To overcome these weak properties, calcium phosphates can be employed in a bioink to compensate for the lack of certain characteristics. Further, the extracellular matrix of natural bone contains this mineral, resulting in its structural robustness. Thus, calcium phosphates are necessary components of bioink for bone tissue engineering. This review paper examines different recently explored calcium phosphates, as a component of potential bioinks, for the biological, mechanical and structural properties required of 3D bioprinted scaffolds, exploring their distinctive properties that render them favorable biomaterials for bone tissue engineering. The discussion encompasses recent applications and adaptations of 3D-printed scaffolds built with calcium phosphates, delving into the scientific reasons behind the prevalence of certain types of calcium phosphates over others. Additionally, this paper elucidates their interactions with polymer hydrogels for 3D bioprinting applications. Overall, the current status of calcium phosphate/hydrogel bioinks for 3D bioprinting in bone tissue engineering has been investigated.

A Pattern Recognition Method for Filter Bags in Bag Dust Collectors Based on Φ-Optical Time-Domain Reflectometry,"The use of phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry (Φ-OTDR)-distributed fiber vibration sensors to detect and identify damaged bags in bag dust collectors has the potential to overcome the inadequacy of traditional damaged bag detection methods. In our previous study, we verified the feasibility of applying this technique in the field of damaged bag detection in bag filters. However, many problems still occur in engineering applications when using this technology to detect and identify damaged filter bags in pulse-jet dust-cleaning bag dust collectors. Further studies are needed to characterize the fiber vibration signals inside different types of rectangular damaged filter bags. A filter bag damage identification and detection method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and a backpropagation (BP) neural network is proposed. The signal feature differences between intact filter bags and damaged filter bags with different rectangular hole sizes and positions are comparatively analyzed, and optimal feature difference parameters are proposed. Support vector machine (SVM) and a BP neural network are used to recognize different types of filter bag signals, and the comparison results show that the BP neural network algorithm is better at recognizing different types of filter bags, obtaining the highest recognition rate of 97.3%.

Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Provenance Blockchain Framework to Mitigate Risks in Cloud Manufacturing in Industry 4.0,"Cloud manufacturing is an evolving networked framework that enables multiple manufacturers to collaborate in providing a range of services, including design, development, production, and post-sales support. The framework operates on an integrated platform encompassing a range of Industry 4.0 technologies, such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices, cloud computing, Internet communication, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and blockchains. The connectivity of industrial equipment and robots to the Internet opens cloud manufacturing to the massive attack risk of cybersecurity and cyber crime threats caused by external and internal attackers. The impacts can be severe because the physical infrastructure of industries is at stake. One potential method to deter such attacks involves utilizing blockchain and artificial intelligence to track the provenance of IIoT devices. This research explores a practical approach to achieve this by gathering provenance data associated with operational constraints defined in smart contracts and identifying deviations from these constraints through predictive auditing using artificial intelligence. A software architecture comprising IIoT communications to machine learning for comparing the latest data with predictive auditing outcomes and logging appropriate risks was designed, developed, and tested. The state changes in the smart ledger of smart contracts were linked with the risks so that the blockchain peers can detect high deviations and take actions in a timely manner. The research defined the constraints related to physical boundaries and weightlifting limits allocated to three forklifts and showcased the mechanisms of detecting risks of breaking these constraints with the help of artificial intelligence. It also demonstrated state change rejections by blockchains at medium and high-risk levels. This study followed software development in Java 8 using JDK 8, CORDA blockchain framework, and Weka package for random forest machine learning. As a result of this, the model, along with its design and implementation, has the potential to enhance efficiency and productivity, foster greater trust and transparency in the manufacturing process, boost risk management, strengthen cybersecurity, and advance sustainability efforts.

Exploring a Novel Material and Approach in 3D-Printed Wrist-Hand Orthoses,"This article proposes the integration of two novel aspects into the production of 3D-printed customized wrist-hand orthoses. One aspect involves the material, particularly Colorfabb varioShore thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) filament with an active foaming agent, which allows adjusting the 3D-printed orthoses’ mechanical properties via process parameters such as printing temperature. Consequently, within the same printing process, by using a single extrusion nozzle, orthoses with varying stiffness levels can be produced, aiming at both immobilization rigidity and skin-comfortable softness. This capability is harnessed by 3D-printing the orthosis in a flat shape via material extrusion-based additive manufacturing, which represents the other novel aspect. Subsequently, the orthosis conforms to the user’s upper limb shape after secure attachment, or by thermoforming in the case of a bi-material solution. A dedicated design web app, which relies on key patient hand measurement input, is also proposed, differing from the 3D scanning and modeling approach that requires engineering expertise and 3D scan data processing. The evaluation of varioShore TPU orthoses with diverse designs was conducted considering printing time, cost, maximum flexion angle, comfort, and perceived wrist stability as criteria. As some of the produced TPU orthoses lacked the necessary stiffness around the wrist or did not properly fit the palm shape, bi-material orthoses including polylactic acid (PLA) inserts of varying sizes were 3D-printed and assessed, showing an improved stiffness around the wrist and a better hand shape conformity. The findings demonstrated the potential of this innovative approach in creating bi-material upper limb orthoses, capitalizing on various characteristics such as varioShore properties, PLA thermoforming capabilities, and the design flexibility provided by additive manufacturing technology.

“Research Mentors Should Support Students of Color by Taking an Extra Step.” Undergraduates’ Reasoning about Race and STEM Research Mentorship,"Racial inequities and the adoption of a colorblind approach in education contribute to a situation wherein many academics lack the personal experience and incentive needed to identify and confront racism within society and institutions. This may be particularly the case in fields related to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), which tend to have lower levels of diversity compared to other fields. The current study examines undergraduates’ perceptions of whether STEM research mentors should consider race when mentoring students from marginalized backgrounds. We employ a mixed-methods approach with the goal of uncovering how undergraduate students perceive and rationalize research mentoring practices. Findings reveal that a strong majority of undergraduate students believe that research mentors should take race into account when mentoring students from marginalized backgrounds. During the qualitative coding process, the research team unearthed seven overarching themes that outline undergraduates’ reasoning, both in favor and against STEM research mentors considering race. We conclude by presenting an intervention intended to motivate individuals to redress colorblind ideologies and thus support a culturally sensitive mentoring style.

A Simple Non-Embedded Single Capillary Device for On-Demand Complex Emulsion Formation,"This study includes an examination of the design, fabrication, and experimentation of a rudimentary droplet generator. The device has potential applications in on-demand double and higher-order emulsions as well as tailored emulsions with numerous cores. The phenomenon of a pendant double droplet creation is observed when an inner phase is transported through a capillary, while a middle phase envelops the external surface of the capillary. This leads to the occurrence of a pinching-off process at the tip of the pulled capillary. Following this, the double droplet is introduced into a container that is filled with the outer phase. The present study examines the force equilibrium throughout the droplet break-up process and aims to forecast the final morphology of the droplets within the container by considering the impact of interfacial tension ratios. The shell thickness in a core–shell formation can be calculated based on the inner and middle phase flow rates as well as the middle droplet formation period. The present platform, which enables the simple production of double and higher emulsions, exhibits promising prospects for the controlled manufacturing of complex emulsions. This technology holds potential for various applications, including the experimental exploration of collision behavior or electro-hydrodynamics in emulsions as well as millimeter-size engineered microparticle fabrication.

Integrated Systems of Light Pipes in Buildings: A State-of-the-Art Review,"Artificial lighting comprises nearly one-third of the total electrical load of buildings, resulting in significant carbon emissions. Reducing the carbon emissions caused by artificial lighting is one of the ways to achieve low-carbon buildings. To meet the demand for high-efficiency, energy-saving, and comfortable lighting, light pipes are increasingly used in buildings. This paper reviews the research and development of light pipes and integrated technology. Sky conditions as a dynamic factor always affect the performance of light pipes. The combination of light pipes and an artificial lighting system can effectively solve this problem. A light pipe can be integrated with a ventilation stack to achieve the ventilation and cooling or heating of a building. A lighting-heating coupled light guide can improve the energy efficiency and sustainability in buildings, such as where antimony tin oxide nanofluid is introduced to absorb additional heat and then provide domestic hot water. The application of a photocatalyst to light pipes can realize air purification and self-cleaning. The use of light pipes does not consume electricity and can reduce the time spent using artificial lighting, thus allowing for power savings. From a whole life cycle perspective, the use of light pipes can be a balance of cost and benefit. In conclusion, such information could be useful for engineers, researchers, and designers to assess the suitability of applying integrated light pipes in different building types and examine the potential of energy and cost savings.

A Review of Catalyst Modification and Process Factors in the Production of Light Olefins from Direct Crude Oil Catalytic Cracking,"Petrochemical feedstocks are experiencing a fast growth in demand, which will further expand their market in the coming years. This is due to an increase in the demand for petrochemical-based materials that are used in households, hospitals, transportation, electronics, and telecommunications. Consequently, petrochemical industries rely heavily on olefins, namely propylene, ethylene, and butene, as fundamental components for their manufacturing processes. Presently, there is a growing interest among refineries in prioritising their operations towards the production of fuels, specifically gasoline, diesel, and light olefins. The cost-effectiveness and availability of petrochemical primary feedstocks, such as propylene and butene, can be enhanced through the direct conversion of crude oil into light olefins using fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). To achieve this objective, the FCC technology, process optimisation, and catalyst modifications may need to be redesigned. It is helpful to know that there are several documented methods of modifying traditional FCC catalysts’ physicochemical characteristics to enhance their selectivity toward light olefins’ production, since the direct cracking of crude oil to olefins is still in its infancy. Based on a review of the existing zeolite catalysts, this work focuses on the factors that need to be optimized and the approaches to modifying FCC catalysts to maximize light olefin production from crude oil conversion via FCC. Several viewpoints have been combined as a result of this research, and recommendations have been made for future work in the areas of optimising the yield of light olefins by engineering the pore structure of zeolite catalysts, reducing deactivation by adding dopants, and conducting technoeconomic analyses of direct crude oil cracking to produce light olefins.

"State of the Art Technologies for High Yield Heterologous Expression and Production of Oxidoreductase Enzymes: Glucose Oxidase, Cellobiose Dehydrogenase, Horseradish Peroxidase, and Laccases in Yeasts P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae","Oxidoreductase (OXR) enzymes are in high demand for biocatalytic applications in the food industry and cosmetics (glucose oxidase (GOx) and cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH)), bioremediations (horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and laccase (LAC)), and medicine for biosensors and miniature biofuel cells (GOx, CDH, LAC, and HRP). They can be used in a soluble form and/or within the yeast cell walls expressed as chimeras on the surface of yeast cells (YSD), such as P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae. However, most of the current studies suffer from either low yield for soluble enzyme expression or low enzyme activity when expressed as chimeric proteins using YSD. This is always the case in studies dealing with the heterologous expression of oxidoreductase enzymes, since there is a requirement not only for multiple OXR gene integrations into the yeast genome (super transformations), and codon optimization, but also very careful design of fermentation media composition and fermentation conditions during expression due to the need for transition metals (copper and iron) and metabolic precursors of FAD and heme. Therefore, scientists are still trying to find the optimal formula using the above-mentioned approaches; most recently, researcher started using protein engineering and directed evolution to increase in the yield of recombinant enzyme production. In this review article, we will cover all the current state-of-the-art technologies and most recent advances in the field that yielded a high expression level for some of these enzymes in specially designed expression/fermentation systems. We will also tackle and discuss new possibilities for further increases in fermentation yield using cutting-edge technologies such as directed evolution, protein and strain engineering, high-throughput screening methods based on in vitro compartmentalization, flow cytometry, and microfluidics.

Support Materials of Organic and Inorganic Origin as Platforms for Horseradish Peroxidase Immobilization: Comparison Study for High Stability and Activity Recovery,"In the presented study, a variety of hybrid and single nanomaterials of various origins were tested as novel platforms for horseradish peroxidase immobilization. A thorough characterization was performed to establish the suitability of the support materials for immobilization, as well as the activity and stability retention of the biocatalysts, which were analyzed and discussed. The physicochemical characterization of the obtained systems proved successful enzyme deposition on all the presented materials. The immobilization of horseradish peroxidase on all the tested supports occurred with an efficiency above 70%. However, for multi-walled carbon nanotubes and hybrids made of chitosan, magnetic nanoparticles, and selenium ions, it reached up to 90%. For these materials, the immobilization yield exceeded 80%, resulting in high amounts of immobilized enzymes. The produced system showed the same optimal pH and temperature conditions as free enzymes; however, over a wider range of conditions, the immobilized enzymes showed activity of over 50%. Finally, a reusability study and storage stability tests showed that horseradish peroxidase immobilized on a hybrid made of chitosan, magnetic nanoparticles, and selenium ions retained around 80% of its initial activity after 10 repeated catalytic cycles and after 20 days of storage. Of all the tested materials, the most favorable for immobilization was the above-mentioned chitosan-based hybrid material. The selenium additive present in the discussed material gives it supplementary properties that increase the immobilization yield of the enzyme and improve enzyme stability. The obtained results confirm the applicability of these nanomaterials as useful platforms for enzyme immobilization in the contemplation of the structural stability of an enzyme and the high catalytic activity of fabricated biocatalysts.

Machine-Learning-Based Deformation Prediction Method for Deep Foundation-Pit Enclosure Structure,"During the construction of deep foundation pits in subways, it is crucial to closely monitor the horizontal displacement of the pit enclosure to ensure stability and safety, and to reduce the risk of structural damage caused by pit deformations. With advancements in machine-learning (ML) techniques and correlation analysis in engineering, data-driven methods that combine ML with engineering monitoring data have become increasingly popular. These methods offer benefits such as high prediction accuracy, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. The main goal of this study was to develop a machine-learning method for predicting the enclosure deformation of deep foundation pits. This was achieved by analyzing the factors influencing deep foundation-pit enclosure deformation and incorporating historical cases and monitoring reports. The performance of each machine-learning prediction model was systematically analyzed and evaluated using K-Fold cross validation. The results revealed that the random forest model outperformed the other models. The result of the test data showed that the random forest model achieved an R2 of 0.9905, an MAE of 0.8572 mm, and an RMSE of 1.9119 mm. Feature importance analysis identified the depth of enclosure structure, water level, surface settlement, axial force, and exposure time as the most critical factors for accurate prediction. The depth of the enclosure structure had an especially significant impact on the prediction of enclosure deformation.

Improving BioWin Modeling of Phosphorus Solubilization in Acid-Phase Digesters,"BioWin 6.0 does not accurately predict phosphorus (P) speciation in acidogenic anaerobic digesters under default kinetics characterization and parameterization. The accurate modeling of acid-phase digestion is needed to predict the performance of novel nutrient recovery technologies that act on these digester effluents. The main thrust of this work was to identify and correct the causes of inaccurate P partitioning and precipitation within BioWin models of acid-phase digestion reactors. A BioWin configuration including an organic acid digester was parameterized and recalibrated based on the known traits of acid-phase digestion and then validated against a full-scale digester in a municipal wastewater treatment plant. This digester, with pH 5.14 and 61–74% solubilized P, was predicted by BioWin default parameters to have only 27% soluble P and a net formation of P precipitates. Corrections to the polyphosphate-accumulating organism decay, endogenous product decay, hydrolysis rate, and brushite behavior resulted in 67% solubilization with no precipitate formation. Cabinet configurations showed similar behavior when modified to include an acid-phase digester under default parameters, but predictions were similarly amended by our parameter changes. This improved modeling technique should allow operators to effectively characterize acid digesters for their own treatment trains and allow engineers to predict the performance of novel nutrient recovery technologies acting on acidogenic digest.

"Exploring the Impacts of Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) Germination on the Flour’s Nutritional, Chemical, Bioactive, and Technological Properties","Germination is a natural, simple, and economical process used to improve the quality of nutritional and technological grains. In this study, native and sprouted sorghum flours were characterized regarding their technological properties (particle size distribution, water, and oil absorption capacity, swelling power and solubility, microscopy of starch granules, and pasting and thermal properties). Nutritional and phytochemical characterization profiles, including free sugars, fatty acids, organic acids, tocopherols, and phenolic compounds, were explored through chromatographic methods. The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic activities of the respective hydroethanolic extracts were also evaluated. The results showed that the germination process caused significant changes in the flour composition and properties, causing reduced gelatinization temperature and retarded starch retrogradation; an increased content of free sugars and total organic acids; and a decreased content of tocopherols and phenolic compounds. In terms of bioactivity, the sprouted sorghum flour extract showed better lipid-peroxidation-inhibition capacity and none of the extracts revealed hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity, which are important results for the validation of the use of the flours for food purposes. Germination is an efficient and alternative method for grain modification that gives improved technological properties without chemical modification or genetic engineering.

Challenging 21st-Century Competencies for STEM Students: Companies’ Vision in Slovenia and Norway in the Light of Global Initiatives for Competencies Development,"Rapid technological innovations are changing the jobs that Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students are employed in after completing their education. Therefore, employers are looking for applicants with skills beyond the specialised professional competencies that can be acquired in the chosen subjects during formal education. Higher education institutions (HEIs) have an important role to play in this process, as they endeavour to equip graduates with the skills and knowledge for future jobs. Our study aims to identify the key competencies that Slovenian and Norwegian companies expect from graduates of selected STEM degree programmes in both countries. Based on these findings, the participating HEIs can tailor their degree programmes to the employability requirements of companies. This study first analysed European and international recommendations and initiatives relevant to skills development in STEM employment and education. We selected 30 key competencies and included them in the questionnaires in which companies’ human resources managers (HRMs) defined their attitudes towards employability skills in the future. We focused on companies employing graduates of the Ecotechnologies and Civil and Environmental Engineering programmes of the participating HEIs. The analysis of the results showed that companies in the two countries have different attitudes towards skills. Four competencies were identified as more important in both countries: (i) management and design of processes, technologies, and people’s work, (ii) adaptation to changes, (iii) ability to manage uncertainty, and (iv) innovation. Based on the analysis, we have developed a framework of ten employability skills for STEM students. In addition, this study provides the basis for operating a decision support system (DSS) to monitor the development of students’ competencies. The DSS is being developed as part of the RESPO-VI project supported by the Norway Grants to better match the skills of STEM students as future job seekers with the needs of potential employers. The study’s results will also help other formal and non-formal education adapt their curricula and thus reduce the employability skill gaps between current STEM education and future labour market needs.

A Case Study for Stability Analysis of a Toppling Bank Slope with Fault Fracture Zones Developed under the Action of Bridge Loads and Reservoir Water,"The mountainous areas of Southwest China have the characteristics of valley deep-cutting, a large topographic gradient, complex geological structures, etc. With the development of infrastructure construction in the area, the construction of bridges across valleys has gradually increased, and the phenomenon of slope failure occurs more and more frequently. As the weak interlayer, the fault fracture zones have a significant influence on the geological structure and stability of slopes, while the complexity of the mechanism of the deformation and failure of slopes increases with the combination of the development of the fracture zones and toppling deformation. This paper took the toppling bank slope of bridge foundations developed with fault fracture zones in Lancang River as the research object. Through an on-site field survey and geological survey technologies, it identified the distribution range of the fracture zones on the bank slope and determined the characteristics of the rock mass in the fracture zones. A stability evaluation model for the bank slope of the bridge foundations was established using the limit equilibrium method and discrete element method. Based on the two-dimensional limit equilibrium analysis, the potential failure modes of the bank slope were explored, and the stability of the bank slope under bridge loads was calculated. Through the three-dimensional geological model of the bank slope, including the fracture zones and toppling bodies, the three-dimensional discrete element numerical simulation method was adopted to simulate and calculate the deformation and failure process of the bank slope under different bridge loads and working conditions. According to the calculation results, the influence of bridge loads and reservoir water on the stability of the bank slope was analyzed from the perspectives of displacement, plastic zone, stability coefficient, and other factors. The formation process of the plastic zone and the development of the sliding surface were revealed, the incentive mechanism of bridge loads and reservoir water on the deformation and failure of the bank slope was analyzed, and the influence of fault fracture zones on the stability of the bank slope and the development of toppling deformation was determined. The results indicate that the fault fracture zones are important geological structures that affect the deformation and failure of the bank slope as a weak interlayer. Under the influence of bridge loads and reservoir water, the stability of the bank slope is affected by the quality of the rock mass and the development of the fault fracture zones, resulting in the unmet need for safety requirements and maybe leading to instability. Based on the calculation results of the stability evaluation prediction model for the bridge foundation bank slope and the engineering geological conditions, the bridge scheme has been selected.

A Robust Generator–Harvester for Independent Sensor Systems,"The research is centered on energy production and harvesting to facilitate the transformation of electrical energy with energy-independent sensor systems, using powering devices in the expected power range of P = 10–10,000 W. A model application case for a harvester is the conversion of energy stored in the compressed gas during expansion; such gas embodies the energy stored in scenarios such as braking a car using an auxiliary pump. Similar systems find use in sensing various quantities in the transport sector (bridge structures, infrastructural components, cars, and other objects). The proposed theoretical harvester models describing the transformation of linear motion energy into electricity provide relevant support for the experiments. In the given context, the results obtained in the designing and construction of a robust motion generator with a primarily linear geometry-based system technology are presented, too. The expected output of electrical power of an N-segment harvester within the tested type is variable, and the design exploits the rectilinear motion generated by an engine using compressed air, a small fuel system, and similar options to obtain an expected/adjustable N-segment power in the range of Psm = 10–500 W. The fundamental structure of the generator core has been continuously numerically modeled, and an experimental setup has been developed to analyze the specific parts and variations in order to validate the concept and to achieve the most suitable parameters with the selected construction materials (a power yield increase of up to 2000 times). A scaled-down version of the model principle was tested in the experiments, and the parameters and results were compared with the predicted theoretical analyses. Generally, the conceptual layout of an enhanced magnetic circuit layout transforming motion energy into electricity was presented and verified.

The Survival of Salmonella enterica Strains in Ready-to-Eat Fruit Purees under Different Storage Temperatures,"Salmonella enterica, known for its resilience to acidic environments, has been linked to foodborne outbreaks of illness from fruit derivatives. This study aimed to assess the survival of five serovars of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica in various fruit purees subjected to different storage temperatures. Among the studied serovars, S. enteritidis exhibited the most significant population decrease in all fruit purees. In contrast, S. Agona, S. Gaminara, S. Michigan, and S. Montevideo survived in peach puree at 4 °C for at least 3 days, and S. Agona, S. Gaminara, and S. Montevideo maintained their initial levels in pear puree under the same time/temperature conditions. However, none of the strains were detectable in plum and black currant purees after 2 days at 4, 15, or 25 °C. These findings highlight variations in the behaviour of S. enterica serovars within different fruit purees. Likewise, low-temperature conditions prolonged the survival of the tested strains in all fruit purees analysed.

"Cognitive Effort during Visuospatial Problem Solving in Physical Real World, on Computer Screen, and in Virtual Reality","Spatial cognition plays a crucial role in academic achievement, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) domains. Immersive virtual environments (VRs) have the growing potential to reduce cognitive load and improve spatial reasoning. However, traditional methods struggle to assess the mental effort required for visuospatial processes due to the difficulty in verbalizing actions and other limitations in self-reported evaluations. In this neuroergonomics study, we aimed to capture the neural activity associated with cognitive workload during visuospatial tasks and evaluate the impact of the visualization medium on visuospatial task performance. We utilized functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) wearable neuroimaging to assess cognitive effort during spatial-reasoning-based problem-solving and compared a VR, a computer screen, and a physical real-world task presentation. Our results reveal a higher neural efficiency in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during 3D geometry puzzles in VR settings compared to the settings in the physical world and on the computer screen. VR appears to reduce the visuospatial task load by facilitating spatial visualization and providing visual cues. This makes it a valuable tool for spatial cognition training, especially for beginners. Additionally, our multimodal approach allows for progressively increasing task complexity, maintaining a challenge throughout training. This study underscores the potential of VR in developing spatial skills and highlights the value of comparing brain data and human interaction across different training settings.

Embrittlement Mechanisms of HR3C Pipe Steel at Room Temperature in Ultra-Supercritical Unit,"HR3C steel is an austenitic high-temperature-resistant steel. Because of its good strength and high-temperature performance, it has been widely used in ultra-supercritical power plant boilers. With the increasingly frequent start-up and shutdown of thermal power units, leakages of HR3C steel pipes have occasionally occurred due to the embrittlement of HR3C pipe steel after a long service duration. In this study, the embrittlement mechanisms of HR3C pipe steel are investigated systematically. The mechanical properties of the pipe steel after running for 70,000 h in an ultra-supercritical unit were determined. As a comparison, the pipe steel supplied in the same batch was aged at 700 degrees Celsius for 500 h. The mechanical properties and the micro-precipitation of the aged counterparts were also determined for comparison. The results show that the embrittlement of HR3C pipe steel in service for 70,000 h is obvious. The average impact absorption is only 5.5 J, which is a decrease of 96.7%. It is found that embrittlement of HR3C steel also occurs after 500 h of aging at 700 °C, and the average value of impact absorption energy decreases by 70.4%. The comparison experiment between the in-service pipe steel and the aged pipe steel shows that in the rapid decline stage of the impact toughness of HR3C steel, the M23C6 carbide in the microstructure has a continuous chain distribution in the grain boundary. There were no other precipitated phases observed. The rapid precipitation and aggregation of M23C6 carbides leads to the initial embrittlement of HR3C steel at room temperature. The CRFe-type σ phase was found in the transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of the steel pipe after 70 thousand hours of use. The precipitation of the σ phase further induces the embrittlement of HR3C pipe steel after a long service duration.

Adsorption Properties and Wettability of Ethoxy- and Propoxy- Derivatives of 2-Ethylhexanol as Sterically Specific Surfactant Structures,"2-ethylhexanol, an oxo alcohol competitively priced on the global market, has not been explored intensively as a raw material for surfactants, due to its weak hydrophobic character. However, its sequenced propoxylation and ethoxylation yield an innovative amphiphilic structure, which exhibits unique interfacial activity. The paper presents the differences in the fractional composition of innovative surfactants derived from 2-EH alcohol prepared using alkali and dimetalcyanide catalysts, as well as examples of excellent adsorption and interfacial properties of the latter. The adsorption behavior of the synthesized compounds was explored using equilibrium surface tension (the du Noüy ring method), dynamic surface tension (the maximum gas bubble pressure method) and static/dynamic contact angle (the sessile drop method). The results from the adsorption tests conducted at the air/aqueous surfactant solution interface underwent comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analyses. Moreover, based on the experimentally obtained dynamic surface tension isotherms and the developed algorithm, the diffusion coefficients for these preparations were estimated, and it was shown that the diffusivity of these surfactants is higher compared to the commercial formulations. The study’s outcomes in the testing of wettability indicate that new synthesized nonionic and anionic surfactants constitute an interesting group of amphiphiles with a wide application potential as effective wetting agents, especially in relation to the polymer surface. It should therefore be emphasized that the innovative surfactants described in this article, derived from 2-EH alcohol and prepared using dimetalcyanide catalysts, can successfully compete with conventional preparations such as ABS (Dodecylbenzenesulfonic Acid) or AES (Alcohol Ethoxysulphate) acid salts.

Selected composition: T 0.1 was used to prepare self-adhesives in industrial-scale production. Moreover, conducted test results revealed that the addition of talc delayed the thermal decomposition of the adhesive and provided reduced intensity of smoke emissions during combustion as well as the flammability of the adhesive layer.

An Engineered M13 Filamentous Nanoparticle as an Antigen Carrier for a Malignant Melanoma Immunotherapeutic Strategy,"Bacteriophages, prokaryotic viruses, hold great potential in genetic engineering to open up new avenues for vaccine development. Our study aimed to establish engineered M13 bacteriophages expressing MAGE-A1 tumor peptides as a vaccine for melanoma treatment. Through in vivo experiments, we sought to assess their ability to induce robust immune responses. Using phage display technology, we engineered two M13 bacteriophages expressing MAGE-A1 peptides as fusion proteins with either pVIII or pIIII coat proteins. Mice were intraperitoneally vaccinated three times, two weeks apart, using two different engineered bacteriophages; control groups received a wild-type bacteriophage. Serum samples taken seven days after each vaccination were analyzed by ELISA assay, while splenocytes harvested seven days following the second boost were evaluated by ex vivo cytotoxicity assay. Fusion proteins were confirmed by Western blot and nano-LC-MS/MS. The application of bacteriophages was safe, with no adverse effects on mice. Engineered bacteriophages effectively triggered immune responses, leading to increased levels of anti-MAGE-A1 antibodies in proportion to the administered bacteriophage dosage. Anti-MAGE-A1 antibodies also exhibited a binding capability to B16F10 tumor cells in vitro, as opposed to control samples. Splenocytes demonstrated enhanced CTL cytotoxicity against B16F10 cells. We have demonstrated the immunogenic capabilities of engineered M13 bacteriophages, emphasizing their potential for melanoma immunotherapy.

"Digital Technologies, Sustainability, and Efficiency in Grain Post-Harvest Activities: A Bibliometric Analysis","Post-harvest grain processes play a crucial role in food supply chains. Recent research focuses on how digital technologies can minimize grain losses, enhance food safety, and reduce their environmental impacts. The relationship between technologies and efficiency and sustainability needs more clarity, particularly concerning critical control points in post-harvest activities. The purpose of this article is to establish a connection between digital technologies used in food supply chains and critical control points within post-harvest systems. The research method is a bibliometric analysis. A literature survey identified thirteen digital technologies. The most published technologies are simulation, automation, and artificial intelligence. The least is augmented reality. Previous research identified nine critical control points in post-harvest engineering solutions, responsible for most losses in efficiency and environmental impacts. A framework using a sample of recent case studies was constructed to relate digital technologies and critical control points. The primary contribution of the study is a categorized list of the most influential technologies corresponding to each control point. The significance and novelty lie in providing managers and practitioners in engineering solutions for post-harvest systems with a practical guide for decision-making in the selection of technologies for future projects. Ultimately, this aids in reducing losses and environmental impact.

Leader-Following Consensus of Discrete-Time Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems with Asymmetric Saturation Impulsive Control,"Impulsive control is an effective approach for coordinating multi-agent systems in practical environments due to its high robustness and low cost. However, impulsive control exhibits characteristics such as high amplitude and rapid variation, potentially presenting threats to the equipment. Additionally, multi-agent systems are constrained by input saturation due to limitations in physical controller structures and information-processing capabilities. These saturation constraints may be asymmetrical. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the saturation constraint when implementing impulsive control, as it can also mitigate the threats posed by the impulse to agents. This paper investigates the leader-following consensus for a class of discrete-time nonlinear multi-agent systems, proposing an asymmetric saturation impulsive control protocol to reduce the energy consumption and damage to the equipment. Regarding the handle of asymmetric saturation, an approach is proposed that eliminates the need for transformation from the asymmetric case to the symmetric case, which retains the saturation function and directly introduces the sector condition to deal with saturation nonlinearity. Furthermore, based on Lyapunov stability theory and matrix theory, sufficient conditions for leader-following consensus in discrete-time nonlinear multi-agent systems under asymmetric saturation impulsive control are established, and the admissible region of the system is estimated. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to verify the validity of the theoretical results.

"Energy and Economic Sustainability of a Small-Scale Hybrid Renewable Energy System Powered by Biogas, Solar Energy, and Wind","Reduction or elimination of reliance on traditional fossil fuels and of the emission of greenhouse gases and pollutants into the environment are affecting energy technologies, systems, and applications. In this context, one potential approach to achieving sustainability, decarbonization, and ensuring the energy and economic viability of existing and future energy systems involves adopting one or more renewable sources. The presented paper concentrates on examining the performance of a small-scale hybrid renewable polygeneration system. This system utilizes biogas produced through anaerobic digestion, which is then supplied to an internal combustion engine, along with solar energy converted into electrical energy by photovoltaic modules and wind energy harnessed through a wind turbine. A small-scale user, represented by residential buildings and a zootechnical farm with heating, cooling, and electrical energy demands, serves as the case study. TRNSYS software is employed to design and model the system, considering realistic assumptions about technical aspects and user energy requirements. The investigation involves analyzing the system’s operation, considering both energy and economic perspectives. The paper discusses the pros and cons of combining biogas, solar, and wind energy in the proposed hybrid system under the considered case study. Despite non-satisfactory economic profitability without incentives, the proposed system allows one to save significant amounts of primary energy and carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.

Alternative Performance Indices-Based Control Technique for a Unity Power Factor Three-Phase Rectifier,"The implementation of a unity power factor (UPF) three-phase rectifier has the potential to enhance the power factor (PF). However, the PF and total harmonic distortion (THD) experience degradation in low-output regions due to the utilization of a “critical input inductor” under rated load conditions. In this study, an analysis of the operation principle of a UPF three-phase rectifier is conducted and a reference compensation current technique based on alternative performance indices is proposed. The optimal control algorithm is utilized to calculate the single harmonic phase delay of each phase and determine the compensator gain, taking into account factors such as the single harmonic distortion limit, THD limit, PF, and active power consumption. The output of the current compensator serves as the desired current source, which in turn drives the bidirectional switches. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control technique can significantly mitigate power supply current distortion, and the input power factor has been effectively improved within a wider load range.

High-Temperature Steam and Atmospheric Oxidation Characteristic of a Heat-Resistant SP2215 Steel,"The high-temperature oxidation performance of SP2215 has become an important issue when they were used as superheaters and reheaters exposed to two different high-temperature environments. In this study, the oxidation behavior of SP2215 steel was investigated under steam and an atmosphere of 650–800 °C for 240 h. The microstructural and chemical characterization of the samples were performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), a glow discharge optical emission spectrometer (GD-OES), and atomic force microscope (AFM). The kinetic curves of oxidation revealed excellent oxidation resistance under both environments, but significant different oxidation characteristics, oxide film composition, and structure were obvious. In the steam experiment, selective intergranular oxidation was evident at relatively low temperatures, which was attributed to the preference absorption of supercritical water molecules at the grain boundary. Conversely, a double-layer structure of outer Fe2O3 and a small amount of Fe3O4 and inner Cr2O3 was formed uniformly at 800 °C. In the high-temperature atmosphere experiment, a protective chromium film was dominant at 650–700 °C, and a loose multicomponent oxide film was formed at 750–800 °C, primarily consisting of Cr2O3, spinel FeCr2O4, and CuO.

Enhancing Sustainability and Antifungal Properties of Biodegradable Composites: Caffeine-Treated Wood as a Filler for Polylactide,"This study investigates the suitability of using caffeine-treated and untreated black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) wood as a polylactide filler. Composites containing 10%, 20%, and 30% filler were investigated in terms of increasing the nucleating ability of polylactide, as well as enhancing its resistance to microorganisms. Differential scanning calorimetry studies showed that the addition of caffeine-treated wood significantly altered the crystallization behavior of the polymer matrix, increasing its crystallization temperature and degree of crystallinity. Polarized light microscopic observations revealed that only the caffeine-treated wood induced the formation of transcrystalline structures in the polylactide. Incorporation of the modified filler into the matrix was also responsible for changes in the thermal stability and decreased hydrophilicity of the material. Most importantly, the use of black cherry wood treated with caffeine imparted antifungal properties to the polylactide-based composite, effectively reducing growth of Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium culmorum, Alternaria alternata, and Trichoderma viride. For the first time, it was reported that treatment of wood with a caffeine compound of natural origin alters the supermolecular structure, nucleating abilities, and imparts antifungal properties of polylactide/wood composites, providing promising insights into the structure-properties relationship of such composites.

A Numerical Simulation of the Coal Dust Migration Law in Directional Air Drilling in a Broken Soft Coal Seam,"Abundant industrial experiences have shown that directional air drilling technology is effective for gas drainage when drilling broken and soft coal seams. In this paper, the Eulerian–Eulerian model was used to simulate the gas–solid two-phase flow behavior of compressed air transporting coal dust in broken soft coal seams. The relationship between the degree of coal dust deposition, annular air pressure law, transportation of coal dust, aforementioned factors of rotational speed, particle size, and air volume could be determined. The results indicate that the particle size plays a significant role in the transport capacity of coal dust. Smaller particle sizes and a higher airflow result in a lower deposition degree of coal dust. When the particle size of coal dust is 1.69 mm and the airflow is 300 m3/h, in the case of coal dust generation at a rate of 0.24 m3/h, the deflection angle of the coal dust collection zone is increased by 130% as the rotational speed of the drill rod is increased from 0 to 120 rpm. Similarly, the deflection angle of the coal dust collection zone is increased by 12.8% in a 500 m3/h airflow under the same condition. Additionally, fine particle-sized coal dust is transported in a spiral line. The coal dust with larger particle sizes tends to be in the middle and lower parts of the hole and move along a specific trajectory. Industrial experiences of medium-air-pressure drilling confirm that a rotary drilling speed between 80 and 120 rpm, with a minimum air volume of 400 m3/h and preferably 500 m3/h, can promote a smooth hole drilling effect and enhance the construction safety in the gas drainage process.

Problem-Based Learning versus Traditional Learning in Physics Education for Engineering Program Students,"Problem-based learning (PBL) is an educational method which involves learning by solving real problems. However, applying a PBL approach to engineering subjects in some cases became a challenging issue. Thus, it is important to determine the best ways in which engineering students can learn physics more effectively and solve problems relevant to their daily lives. The main aim of this study was to compare the final assessment grades in a physics course for students in the engineering program using PBL and traditional learning (TL) methods. The advantages and disadvantages of PBL and TL methods from the practical experience of lecturers are also presented. The study presented data of 460 first-year engineering students taking the physics course at Kaunas University of Technology. The information presented in this study is based on the insights, observations, and individual experiences of the authors as teaching staff. The results indicated that the application of the PBL method allows for enhancement in the teamwork, presentation, and critical thinking skills in physics. However, the TL method promotes the individual learning skills and wider theoretical knowledge in physics of students and is more suitable when the exam only includes closed-ended questions.

Study on the Effect of Electrolytes on Processing Efficiency and Accuracy of Titanium Alloy Utilizing Laser and Shaped Tube Electrochemical Machining,"Electrochemical machining (ECM) has become more prevalent in titanium alloy processing. However, the presence of the passivation layer on the titanium alloys significantly impacts the performance of ECM. In an attempt to overcome the passivation effects, a high-temperature electrolyte or the addition of halogen ions to the electrolyte has been used. Still, it often results in compromised machining accuracy and surface roughness. This study applied laser and shaped tube electrolytic machining (Laser-STEM) for titanium alloy drilling, where the laser was guided to the machining zone via total internal reflection. The performance of Laser-STEM using different types of electrolytes was compared. Further, the effects of laser power and pulse voltage on the machining side gap, material removal rate (MRR), and surface roughness were experimentally studied while drilling small holes in titanium alloy. The results indicated that the use of passivating electrolytes improved the machining precision, while the MRR decreased with an increase in laser power during Laser-STEM. The MRR showed an increase while using aggressive electrolytes; however, at the same time, the machining precision deteriorated with the increase in laser power. Particularly, the maximum feeding rate of 6.0 mm/min for the tool electrode was achieved using NaCl solution as the electrolyte during Laser-STEM, marking a 100% increase compared to the rate without the use of a laser. Moreover, the model and equivalent circuits were also established to illustrate the material removal mechanisms of Laser-STEM in different electrolytes. Lastly, the processing of deep small holes with a diameter of 1.5 mm, a depth of 38 mm, and a surface roughness of Ra 2 µm was achieved via Laser-STEM without the presence of a recast layer and heat-affected zones. In addition, the cross-inner flow channels in the titanium alloys were effectively processed.

Exploring Energy Security and Independence for Small Energy Users: A Latvian Case Study on Unleashing Stirling Engine Potential,"Nowadays, energy systems are continuously impacted by external and internal conditions. The worldwide events of recent years have led to the need to consider not only the requirements for moving towards climate neutrality but also the security and independence of energy supply when creating new or transforming existing energy systems. The aim of this study was to answer the question of whether there is a possibility of transforming the energy supply process by promoting increased energy security and independence while not reducing energy demand, as well as creating high economic and environmental indicators. The research focuses on developing alternative scenarios for further decision-making studies by introducing modern energy technologies. Scenarios are analysed using the complex method developed, which includes three main steps: assessing the current situation, identifying available technologies, and assessing alternatives. The results suggest that Stirling’s technology can provide 100% energy independence for individual energy consumers. At the same time, thanks to the combination of Stirling technology and solar technologies, there is an opportunity to reduce emissions and energy production costs, but capital investment is increasing.

Emerging Sustainability in Carbon Capture and Use Strategies for V4 Countries via Biochemical Pathways: A Review,"The world is moving towards decarbonization policies in the energy and industrial sectors to bring down carbon dioxide release and reach net zero emissions. Technologies to capture CO2 and use it as a feedstock to produce CO2-based chemicals and biofuels via chemical or biochemical conversion pathways can potentially reduce the amount of CO2 released. The paper serves the innovative scientific knowledge for CO2 transformation via a biochemical pathway to microalgal biomass with its subsequent treatment to biofuels and bioproducts assuming milder climatic conditions (Central or Eastern Europe, Visegrad countries or climatically related world regions). The recent trends were critically reviewed for microalgal biorefinery to reach the sustainability of microalgal-based chemicals with added value, digestion, hydrothermal liquefaction, pyrolysis, and gasification of microalgal residues. Knowledge-based chemical process engineering analysis, systematic data synthesis, and critical technical evaluation of available life cycle assessment studies evaluated the sustainability of microalgal biorefinery pathways. The research showed that biological CO2 fixation using water, seawater or wastewater to produce third-generation biomass is a promising alternative for bioethanol production via pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, digestion, and distillation, and can be realized on a large scale in an economically viable and environmentally sound manner. Its best economically promising and sustainable pathway is perceived in producing microalgal-based nutraceuticals, bioactive medical products, and food products such as proteins, pigments, and vitamins. Machine learning methods for data mining, process control, process optimization, and geometrical configuration of reactors and bioreactors are the crucial research needs and challenges to implementing microalgal biorefinery in an operational environment.

Fabrication of Air Conditioning Antimicrobial Filter for Electrically Powered Port Tractors via Electrospinning Coating,"With the stricter emission regulations for internal combustion engines, electric vehicles, including electrically powered port tractors, have received increasing attention. However, currently, most of the filters used in electric vehicles are conventional membranes that only have the function of filtering particles and foreign objects. Therefore, in order to improve the above issues, the surface of commercial non-woven filter membranes was coated with Ag nanopowder nanofibers and AgNO3 nanofibers via electrospinning. At present, the comparative research on the antibacterial ability of Ag nanopowder and AgNO3 is still blank in the same research system, especially with the use of electrospun coating technology. The morphologies and structures of non-woven fabrics and electrospinning coated samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The characterization results indicate that both pure PVA and PVA composite fibers can be successfully coated on the surface of non-woven fabrics. The average diameter of all electrospun PVA composite fibers is distributed in the range of 470–700 nm. The PVA nanofibers with a low content of 1 wt% AgNO3 have good antibacterial properties against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), with clearance clear zones of inhibition of 26.00 mm and 17.30 mm, respectively.

Unlocking the Potential of Cable-Driven Continuum Robots: A Comprehensive Review and Future Directions,"Rigid robots have found wide-ranging applications in manufacturing automation, owing to their high loading capacity, high speed, and high precision. Nevertheless, these robots typically feature joint-based drive mechanisms, possessing limited degrees of freedom (DOF), bulky structures, and low manipulability in confined spaces. In contrast, continuum robots, drawing inspiration from biological structures, exhibit characteristics such as high compliance, lightweight designs, and high adaptability to various environments. Among them, cable-driven continuum robots (CDCRs) driven by multiple cables offer advantages like higher dynamic response compared to pneumatic systems and increased working space and higher loading capacity compared to shape memory alloy (SMA) drives. However, CDCRs also exhibit some shortcomings, including complex motion, drive redundancy, challenging modeling, and control difficulties. This study presents a comprehensive analysis and summary of CDCR research progress across four key dimensions: configuration design, kinematics and dynamics modeling, motion planning, and motion control. The objective of this study is to identify common challenges, propose solutions, and unlock the full potential of CDCRs for a broader range of applications.

Conceptual Design of a Hydrogen-Hybrid Dual-Fuel Regional Aircraft Retrofit,"A wide range of aircraft propulsion technologies is being investigated in current research to reduce the environmental impact of commercial aviation. As the implementation of purely hydrogen-powered aircraft may encounter various challenges on the airport and vehicle side, combined hydrogen and kerosene energy sources may act as an enabler for the first operations with liquid hydrogen propulsion technologies. The presented studies describe the conceptual design of such a dual-fuel regional aircraft featuring a retrofit derived from the D328eco under development by Deutsche Aircraft. By electrically assisting the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) burning conventional turboprop engines with the power of high-temperature polymer-electrolyte fuel cells, the powertrain architecture enables a reduction of SAF consumption. All aircraft were modeled and investigated using the Bauhaus Luftfahrt Aircraft Design Environment. A description of this design platform and the incorporated methods to model the hydrogen-hybrid powertrain is given. Special emphasis was laid on the implications of the hydrogen and SAF dual-fuel system design to be able to assess the potential benefits and drawbacks of various configurations with the required level of detail. Retrofit assumptions were applied, particularly retaining the maximum takeoff mass while reducing payload to account for the propulsion system mass increase. A fuel cell power allocation of 20% led to a substantial 12.9% SAF consumption decrease. Nonetheless, this enhancement necessitated an 18.1% payload reduction, accompanied by a 34.5% increment in propulsion system mass. Various additional studies were performed to assess the influence of the power split. Under the given assumptions, the design of such a retrofit was deemed viable.

Of Microscopes and Meeting Places: A Literature Review Examining Barriers to Indigenous Participation in STEM,"STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) was once not seen as a place for everyone. In fact, a powerful majority of people believed that individuals had to have predetermined characteristics that made them able to bear such vast and liberating knowledge. Centuries later, concentrated efforts are still needed to reverse the damage that the prevalence of such an ideology caused. When one considers the exclusion of individuals from a particular field, they may only see one side of the story; they may think that the only factor stopping the out-group from participating is the in-group trying to keep them out. The bigger picture tells the story of the consequences of enduring exclusion of the out-group, even well after explicit exclusionary tactics cease to exist. The awareness and study of this phenomenon in regard to several groups of historically excluded people have expanded in the modern era, helping to reduce its lasting effects. Some groups continue to participate in STEM at a much lower rate than their peers. Native Americans are a particularly interesting example of this. This review will explore some of the various reasons posed for the way and rate at which Native Americans are involved in STEM education and will attempt to determine the prevalence of each explanation and their interactions with each other.

Sustainability Evaluation of Hybrid Agriculture-Tractor Powertrains,"Agricultural tractors are highly fuel-consuming and soil/air polluting machines; thus, the introduction of new sustainable technologies, such as hybridization, can be very impactful for the development of electric hybrid agricultural tractors. These vehicles combine the classic internal combustion engine with an electric machine. This paper reports the modeling and simulation, conducted using a simulation software typically used for on-road vehicles, of a two-wheel-drive agricultural tractor in three different configurations: the conventional one, and the series and parallel electric-hybrid powertrains. The simulated task is the trailing of a “big square baler” during the process of straw wrapping and baling. The evaluation and the comparison of the fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and the depth of discharge of the different configurations have been carried out to determine if it is possible to downsize the ICE while maintaining the same performance levels. This study highlights the fact that both the fuel consumption and the CO2 emissions of series and parallel electric-hybrid agricultural tractors are ten times lower and five times lower than those of a traditional tractor, respectively. Furthermore, the presence of an electric machine allows a more precise speed profile tracking. This study points out that the hybridization of agricultural tractor powertrains is one of the most promising approaches for reducing pollutant emissions and fuel consumption.

Evolving Paradigms of Recombinant Protein Production in Pharmaceutical Industry: A Rigorous Review,"Many beneficial proteins have limited natural availability, which often restricts their supply and thereby reduces their potential for therapeutic or industrial usage. The advent of recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology enables the utilization of different microbes as surrogate hosts to facilitate the production of these proteins. This microbial technology continues to evolve and integrate with modern innovations to develop more effective approaches for increasing the production of recombinant biopharmaceuticals. These strategies encompass fermentation technology, metabolic engineering, the deployment of strong promoters, novel vector elements such as inducers and enhancers, protein tags, secretion signals, synthetic biology, high-throughput devices for cloning, and process screening. This appraisal commences with a general overview regarding the manufacture of recombinant proteins by microbes and the production of biopharmaceuticals, their trends towards the development of biopharmaceuticals, and then discusses the approaches adopted for accomplishing this.

Effects of Bias Voltages on the Tribological Behaviors of DLC Coatings,"Ti/TiN/(Ti,N)-DLC/Ti-DLC/DLC coatings were deposited on 431 stainless steel using direct current magnetron sputtering technology under different bias voltages(0 V, −100 V, −200 V and −300 V). The microstructure and tribocorrosion performance of these DLC coatings in seawater was investigated. The results indicated that under the bias voltages, a denser and smoother surface of DLC coatings with a higher bonding strength between coatings and substrates was observed related to the increased incident kinetic energy of deposited ionized atoms. When the bias voltage was −200 V, the surface roughness reduced from 9.81 nm to 7.03 nm, and the bonding strength enhanced from 8.23 N to 8.86 N. What is more, the sp3 bond proportion and the disorder degree in DLC coatings both increased, which resulted in improved hardness and deformation resistance. However, when the bias voltage was −300 V, the increase of the amorphization was associated with a simultaneous rise in internal stress, which reduced the hardness and bond strength a little (8.72 N). DLC coatings can effectively improve the tribocorrosion properties of 431 stainless steel in seawater. When the voltage was −200 V, the average friction coefficient decreased from 0.35 to 0.07, with shallower wear traces and the wear loss of the DLC coating also being the smallest. The abrasive wear caused by metal oxides falling off the grinding ball, and the plastic deformation of the DLC coatings are the main wear forms. The high-density structure of DLC coatings under bias voltages can not only prevent the rapid expansion of cracks during deformation, but also provides a physical barrier to the erosion, which improves the corrosion and friction resistance in seawater. The optimization of bias voltage can improve the tribological performance of DLC coatings by regulating the carbon chain bond and microstructure. These results provide reference for DLC preparation and their potential engineering applications in stainless steel.

Greater Energy Independence with Sustainable Steel Production,"Global energy market price volatility and an upward trajectory of prices per unit of electricity have sent all industrial sectors and many economies to the brink of recession. Alongside the urgent need for decarbonisation of all industries, achieving a globally higher level of energy independence across all sectors seems imperative. A multi-disciplinary approach with a proposed system of CO2 emissions reduction and capture technologies has the potential for short-term emissions reduction to near-zero in the steel industry—although some of the mechanisms can be implemented across most heavy industries. The findings of this research show a CO2 emissions reduction of ~30% from 977 t of CO2 to 684 t in one single blast furnace production cycle (based on 330 tonnes of liquid iron production capacity, with the mean of 2.1–3.2 tonnes CO2/t of steel and chemical reactions emissions applied), by switching the electricity provider for operating the electric heaters to providers generating energy exclusively from renewable sources. Replacing coal with biomass and adding post-combustion capture units to the blast furnace operation, will add carbon neutrality into the process—resulting in CO2 emissions reduction to near-zero. Carbon capture from biomass utilisation (BECCS) will add the benefit of carbon-negative emissions to the cycle. Simultaneously, energy-saving and process improvement measures implementation (up to 60% efficiency increase), excess heat recovery <30% of energy savings, and retrofitting renewable energy technology resulted in an energy independence of 88%. Engineering solutions, partly subsidised in the UK, are readily available for implementation in the iron and steel manufacturing industry.

Uncertainly Analysis of Prior Distribution in Accelerated Degradation Testing Bayesian Evaluation Method Based on Deviance Information Criterion,"The accelerated degradation testing (ADT) Bayesian evaluation method comprehensively utilizes product degradation data under accelerated stress levels collected over a short period of time and multiple sources of prior information, such as historical information, similar product information, simulation information, etc., to conduct life and reliability evaluation. Through the prior distribution, prior information affects the ADT Bayesian evaluation results ultimately. However, different evaluators may obtain different prior distributions based on the same prior information due to varying experiences or rules, which may lead to differences in the ADT Bayesian evaluation results. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and study the impact of prior distribution uncertainty on the ADT Bayesian evaluation results while also finding criteria to judge the quality of prior distributions. This paper focuses on the ADT Bayesian evaluation method based on the Wiener process and the Arrhenius relation, studying the influence of different prior distributions on the robustness of ADT Bayesian evaluation results. Additionally, based on the deviance information criterion (DIC), a criterion for selecting prior distributions in the ADT Bayesian evaluation method is proposed. Through carrying out uncertainty analysis of prior distribution in the ADT Bayesian evaluation method, a theoretical system and framework for analyzing prior uncertainty in ADT Bayesian evaluation based on DIC are established, providing a better foundation for the practical application of the ADT Bayesian evaluation method in engineering.

Application of Fiber Optics for Completion Design Optimization: A Methodological Approach and Key Findings,"This study investigates the application of fiber optic technology to optimize completion design in a hydraulic fracture stimulation for Marcellus Shale Reservoir. With a focus on improving cluster efficiencies and overcoming interstage communication challenges, the research utilizes real-time data from distributed acoustic (DAS), temperature (DTS), and strain (DSS) measurements. The methodology comprises a comprehensive analysis of completion and stimulation reports, fiber optics, microseismic data, and well logs. Conducted at the MSEEL well pads, MIP, and Boggess, and equipped with permanent and deployable fiber optic cables, this study emphasizes that engineered/geomechanical completion design leads to sustained cluster efficiency and stage production performance. Inefficient cluster efficiencies are primarily linked to fracture communication. Recommendations include employing a geomechanical completion design, avoiding non-uniform high natural fracture zones during hydraulic fracture stimulations, implementing short stage length, and using more 100 mesh sand. These insights, derived from correlations between fracture counts, distributed strain sensing (DSS), cluster efficiency, production logging, and production data, offer significant implications for optimizing completion design in unconventional reservoirs. The effective application of fiber optic technology, providing real-time DAS, DTS, and slow strain data, proves instrumental in addressing interstage communication challenges, contributing to improved reservoir performances and cost-effective operations in hydraulic fracture stimulations.

Scaled Conjugate Gradient Neural Intelligence for Motion Parameters Prediction of Markov Chain Underwater Maneuvering Target,"This study proposes a novel application of neural computing based on deep learning for the real-time prediction of motion parameters for underwater maneuvering object. The intelligent strategy utilizes the capabilities of Scaled Conjugate Gradient Neural Intelligence (SCGNI) to estimate the dynamics of underwater target that adhere to discrete-time Markov chain. Following a state-space methodology in which target dynamics are combined with noisy passive bearings, nonlinear probabilistic computational algorithms are frequently used for motion parameters prediction applications in underwater acoustics. The precision and robustness of SCGNI are examined here for effective motion parameter prediction of a highly dynamic Markov chain underwater passive vehicle. For investigating the effectiveness of the soft computing strategy, a steady supervised maneuvering route of undersea passive object is designed. In the framework of bearings-only tracking technology, system modeling for parameters prediction is built, and the effectiveness of the SCGNI is examined in ideal and cluttered marine atmospheres simultaneously. The real-time location, velocity, and turn rate of dynamic target are analyzed for five distinct scenarios by varying the standard deviation of white Gaussian observed noise in the context of mean square error (MSE) between real and estimated values. For the given motion parameters prediction problem, sufficient Monte Carlo simulation results support SCGNI’s superiority over typical generalized pseudo-Bayesian filtering strategies such as Interacting Multiple Model Extended Kalman Filter (IMMEKF) and Interacting Multiple Model Unscented Kalman Filter (IMMUKF).

Spatiotemporal Analysis of the Interactions between Ecosystem Services in Arid Areas and Their Responses to Urbanization and Various Driving Factors,"In recent years, rapid urban expansion and increasing ecological sensitivity in arid zones have led to extreme imbalances in ecosystem development. Therefore, there is an urgent need to balance the dual goals of synergistic development of ecosystem services (ESs) and increased urbanization. Previous studies have analyzed the impacts of urbanization on ESs but have selected a limited number of indicators and have not focused on the impacts of urbanization on ES pair interactions. In this study, six key ESs (water yield, habitat quality, soil conservation, carbon storage, carbon sequestration and oxygen production, and food production) and total ecosystem services (TESs) were selected, and trends in the temporal and spatial relationship between trade-offs and synergies were analyzed over 20 years. This study refined the living standards urbanization indicator and evaluated the impact of urbanization and multiple drivers on ESs and ES pair interrelationships based on geo-detectors and segmented linear regression. The results show that there is heterogeneity in the overall and regional ES trade-offs and synergistic relationships, and water yield (WY)-related ES pairs generally exhibit synergistic relationships at the overall level. Spatially, however, the trade-off ratio exceeds the synergy ratio. Segmented linear regression results show that the relationship between all the urbanization indicators and TESs demonstrates an upward trend followed by a downward trend. Measures such as the increase in man-made oases in the early stages of urbanization did have some positive effects on TESs. However, as urbanization increased, these positive effects were quickly offset by the negative effects of overdevelopment and environmental degradation, leading to an overall decline in TESs. Urbanization of construction land (CL) had the most direct impact on ecosystem services. In summary, due to special climatic constraints, arid zones are more sensitive than other ecosystems, and urban development is strictly limited by oasis capacity. As cities expand, attention needs to be focused on protecting ecological land and limiting the expansion of CL to promote the synergistic development of urbanization and ecosystem services in arid zones.

This leads to an increased hydrodynamic volume, particle size, and thermal stability of the gelatin films. Compared to films crosslinked solely by polyphenols or titanium, PTC-crosslinked gelatin films exhibit significant improvements. They show enhanced mechanical properties with a tensile strength that is 1.7 to 2.6 times higher than neat gelatin films. Moreover, these films effectively shield UV light (from 82% to 99%), providing better protection for light-sensitive food ingredients and preserving lutein content (from 74.2% to 78.1%) under light exposure. The incorporation of PTCs also improves film hydrophobicity, as indicated by water contact angles ranging from 115.3° to 131.9° and a water solubility ranging from 31.5% to 33.6%. Additionally, PTC-enhanced films demonstrate a superior antioxidant ability, with a prolonged polyphenol release (up to 18 days in immersed water) and a higher free radical scavenging ability (from 22% to 25.2%). Overall, the improved characteristics of gelatin films enabled by PTCs enhance their performance, making them suitable for various food packaging applications.

Manufacturing 4.0: Checking the Feasibility of a Work Cell Using Asset Administration Shell and Physics-Based Three-Dimensional Digital Twins,"Feasibility checking is a step in manufacturing system engineering for verifying the normalization and effectiveness of a manufacturing system associated with a specific configuration of resources and processes. It enables factory operators to predict problems before operational time, thus preventing equipment and machinery accidents and reducing labor waste in physically organizing the shop floor. In Industry 4.0, feasibility checking becomes even more critical since emerging challenges, such as mass personalization, require reconfiguring work cells quickly and flexibly on demand. Regarding this need, digital twin technologies have emerged as an ideal candidate for practicing feasibility checking. Indeed, they are tools used to implement digital representations of manufacturing entities that can constitute a digital environment and context. Factory operators can test a manufacturing process within a digital environment in different contexts before the execution with physical resources. This approach currently receives significant attention from the manufacturing community; however, there is still a lack of sharing experiences to implement it. Thus, this paper contributes a methodology to engineer a digital environment and context for a manufacturing work cell using AAS digital twins and physics-based 3D digital twins technologies. Technically, this methodology is a specific case of N-DTs, a general methodology for engineering heterogeneous digital twins. The product assembly line case study, also presented in this paper, is a successful experiment applying the above contributions. The two methodologies and the case study can be helpful references for both public and private sectors to deploy their feasibility-checking frameworks and deal with heterogeneous digital twins in general.

Feasibility and Performance Analysis of Cylinder Deactivation for a Heavy-Duty Compressed Natural Gas Engine,"The rising interest in the use of gaseous fuels, such as bio-methane and hydro-methane, in Heavy-Duty (HD) engines to reduce Greenhouse Gases pushed by the net-zero CO2 emissions roadmap, introduced the need for appropriate strategies in terms of fuel economy and emissions reduction. The present work hence aims at analysing the potential benefits derived from the application of the cylinder deactivation strategy on a six-cylinder HD Natural Gas Spark Ignition (SI) engine, typically employed in buses and trucks. The activity stems from an extensive experimental characterisation of the engine, which allowed for validating a related 1D model at several Steady-State conditions over the entire engine workplan and during dynamic phases, represented by the World Harmonized Transient Cycle (WHTC) homologation cycle. The validated model was exploited to assess the feasibility of the considered strategy, with specific attention to the engine working areas at partial load and monitoring the main performance parameters. Moreover, the introduction in the model of an additional pipeline and of valves actuated by a dedicated control logic, allowed for embedding the capability of using Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR). In the identified operating zones, the EGR strategy has shown significant benefits in terms of fuel consumption, with a reduction of up to 10%. Simultaneously, an appreciable increase in the exhaust gas temperature was detected, which may eventually contribute to enhance the Three-Way Catalyst (TWC) conversion efficiency. Considering that few efforts are to be found in the literature but for the application of the cylinder deactivation strategy to Light-Duty or conventionally fuelled vehicles, the present work lays the foundation for a possible application of such technology in Natural Gas Heavy-Duty engines, providing important insights to maximise the efficiency of the entire system.

An Evaluation of the Economic Viability and Accessibility of CRCP and JPCP: A Comparative Analysis,"Road infrastructure serves as a foundational driver of a nation’s economic and cultural growth. Incorporating life cycle cost analysis (LCCA), as well as considerations of availability and environmental impact, enables policymakers to make strategic decisions that not only enhance fiscal efficiency but also support sustainable progress. This paper centers on an in-depth examination of two prevalent pavement technologies: continuously reinforced concrete pavements (CRCP) and jointed plain concrete pavements (JPCP). It specifically delineates the application of these methods to a hypothetical one-kilometer motorway construction in Germany. Employing LCCA for concrete pavements, the paper evaluates long-term fiscal prudence among alternative investment opportunities, factoring in resource utilization—both materials and machinery—and long-term care and upkeep obligations over the pavements’ operational lifespans. The analysis extends to appraise agency expenditures associated with the pair of pavement strategies and estimates the concomitant delay durations and costs relevant to the exemplar project. Central to this research is the investigation of road availability and its quantifiable influence on traffic efficacy, parsing through metrics such as the tally of days roads are out of service and the subsequent repercussions on vehicular flow. The investigation also proposes strategies for the reduction of embodied carbon in CRCP and JPCP systems. While accounting for variances in functional performance and vehicular comfort levels, this study contributes scientifically by tackling pragmatic engineering dilemmas involved in pavement selection, with a spotlight on minimizing costs, curtailing traffic interruptions, and mitigating ecological impacts for the duration of the pavement’s life cycle.

Analysis of the Impact of New Generation Narrow-Body Aircraft on Flexible and Rigid Regional Airport Pavements,"Airport pavements have always evolved to keep pace with the demands of new aircraft. As aircraft weights and tyre pressures increase, stronger, new pavements are designed and existing pavements are rehabilitated or upgraded. The narrow-body commercial jet aircraft, including the A320 and B737 families, are examples of aircraft that have retained the same number of wheels, with the same wheel spacing and the same wingspan, but have increased in weight and tyre pressure by approximately 50%. This places significant demand on airport pavements that were designed for the lighter variants but now face the introduction of the newer, heavier and more demanding variants. This research quantified the impact of the new A320 and B737 narrow-body aircraft variants on rigid and flexible regional airport pavements, where these are the critical aircraft, as well as demonstrating the importance of understanding the operational weight limitations of these aircraft, which is often well below the published maximum weight. Within the context of the pavements considered, the additional pavement thickness required for the heaviest aircraft variants, compared to the lightest variants, was 51%. Based on four examples from real regional airports in Australia, it was found that the additional embodied carbon associated with these new aircraft variants was 2.1–85.3 kg·eCO2/m2 of pavement, while the additional financial cost was AUD 6–219/m2 of pavement. It was concluded that airport pavement thickness designers must challenge the weight of the design aircraft and not take the simple and conservative approach of adopting the maximum weight of the heaviest variant within each aircraft family. By doing so, significant additional pavement thickness will be constructed for no practical benefit, creating an environmental (embodied carbon) and economic (financial cost) burden.

Kinetics and Thermodynamics of the Phase Transformation in the Nanocrystalline Substance—Gas Phase System,"This study presents a model of the reaction of a nanocrystalline substance within the gas phase, where diffusion of gas reactants in the volume of the nanocrystallites is a rate-limiting step. According to the model calculations carried out, the rate of diffusion across the phase boundary located on the nanocrystallite surface limits the rate of the process. It was stated that in chemical processes with a phase transformation, the critical concentration of absorbate depends on two factors: the specific active surface area of the adsorbent and the difference in chemical potentials between the gas phase and the equilibrium potential at which the phase transformation occurs. When the actual adsorbate potential in the gas phase is much greater than the equilibrium potential of the nanocrystallite with the largest specific active surface, nanocrystallites undergo phase changes in the order according to their specific active surfaces from the largest to the smallest. In a process where the actual adsorbate potential is close to an equilibrium one, nanocrystallites undergo phase transformation in the order of their specific active surface from the smallest to the largest.

Re-Engineering Therapeutic Anti-Aβ Monoclonal Antibody to Target Amyloid Light Chain,"Amyloidosis involves the deposition of misfolded proteins. Even though it is caused by different pathogenic mechanisms, in aggregate, it shares similar features. Here, we tested and confirmed a hypothesis that an amyloid antibody can be engineered by a few mutations to target a different species. Amyloid light chain (AL) and β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) are two therapeutic targets that are implicated in amyloid light chain amyloidosis and Alzheimer’s disease, respectively. Though crenezumab, an anti-Aβ antibody, is currently unsuccessful, we chose it as a model to computationally design and prepare crenezumab variants, aiming to discover a novel antibody with high affinity to AL fibrils and to establish a technology platform for repurposing amyloid monoclonal antibodies. We successfully re-engineered crenezumab to bind both Aβ42 oligomers and AL fibrils with high binding affinities. It is capable of reversing Aβ42-oligomers-induced cytotoxicity, decreasing the formation of AL fibrils, and alleviating AL-fibrils-induced cytotoxicity in vitro. Our research demonstrated that an amyloid antibody could be engineered by a few mutations to bind new amyloid sequences, providing an efficient way to reposition a therapeutic antibody to target different amyloid diseases.

Densification and Surface Carbon Transformation of Diamond Powders under High Pressure and High Temperature,"A new type of poly-diamond plate without a catalyst was produced via the high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) compression of diamond powders. The densification of diamond powders and sp3 to sp2 carbon on the surface under HPHT compression was investigated through the characterization of the microstructure, Raman spectroscopy analysis and electrical resistance measurement. The densification and sp3-sp2 transformation on the surface are mainly affected by the pressure, temperature and particle size. The quantitative analysis of the diamond sp3 and sp2 carbon amount was performed through the peak fitting of Raman spectra. It was found that finer diamond particles under a higher temperature and a lower pressure tend to produce more sp2 carbon; otherwise, they produce less. In addition, it is interesting to note that the local residual stresses measured using Raman spectra increase with the diamond particle size. The suspected reason is that the increased particle size reduces the number of contact points, resulting in a higher localized pressure at each contact point. The hypothesis was supported by finite element calculation. This study provides detailed and quantitative data about the densification of diamond powders and sp3 to sp2 transformation on the surface under HPHT treatment, which is valuable for the sintering of polycrystalline diamonds (PCDs) and the HPHT treatment of diamonds.

Exploring the Efficacy of Mixed Reality versus Traditional Methods in Higher Education: A Comparative Study,"“Immersive technology” is a broad and evolving term that encompasses various kinds of technologies and viewpoints, and has applications in various fields, such as education, healthcare, entertainment, the arts, and engineering. This research paper aims to compare the effectiveness of two teaching methods, namely the conventional method (using PowerPoint slides), and the immersive technology method (initiating a mixed reality with a HoloLens 2 device). The experiment involved two groups of students, aged between 19 and 52 years-of-age, who received different types of instruction: the first group viewed a PowerPoint slide with an image of the human muscular system, and the second group viewed a 3D hologram of the human body that displayed the same muscle groups as in the PowerPoint slide. The researchers wanted to examine if mixed reality devices could improve students’ cognitive abilities and explore if the age of the participants had any impact on the effectiveness of the instruction method. The main findings of this study are that the instruction method that used mixed reality technology, the Microsoft HoloLens 2 device, was more suitable for younger participants, and that traditional instruction methods, such as PowerPoint slides, are more appropriate for older students. While this research provides some valuable insights into the factors that influence student performance in anatomy tests, it has some limitations that should be considered.

Genome-Wide Association Studies of Embryogenic Callus Induction Rate in Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.),"The capability of embryogenic callus induction is a prerequisite for in vitro plant regeneration. However, embryogenic callus induction is strongly genotype-dependent, thus hindering the development of in vitro plant genetic engineering technology. In this study, to examine the genetic variation in embryogenic callus induction rate (CIR) in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) at the seventh, eighth, and ninth subcultures (T7, T8, and T9, respectively), we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for CIR in a population of 353 peanut accessions. The coefficient of variation of CIR among the genotypes was high in the T7, T8, and T9 subcultures (33.06%, 34.18%, and 35.54%, respectively), and the average CIR ranged from 1.58 to 1.66. A total of 53 significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected (based on the threshold value −log10(p) = 4.5). Among these SNPs, SNPB03-83801701 showed high phenotypic variance and neared a gene that encodes a peroxisomal ABC transporter 1. SNPA05-94095749, representing a nonsynonymous mutation, was located in the Arahy.MIX90M locus (encoding an auxin response factor 19 protein) at T8, which was associated with callus formation. These results provide guidance for future elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of embryogenic callus induction in peanut.

Detecting Weak Underwater Targets Using Block Updating of Sparse and Structured Channel Impulse Responses,"In this paper, we considered the real-time modeling of an underwater channel impulse response (CIR), exploiting the inherent structure and sparsity of such channels. Building on the recent development in the modeling of acoustic channels using a Kronecker structure, we approximated the CIR using a structured and sparse model, allowing for a computationally efficient sparse block-updating algorithm, which can track the time-varying CIR even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios. The algorithm employs a conjugate gradient formulation, which enables a gradual refinement if the SNR is sufficiently high to allow for this. This was performed by gradually relaxing the assumed Kronecker structure, as well as the sparsity assumptions, if possible. The estimated CIR was further used to form a residual signal containing (primarily) information of the time-varying signal responses, thereby allowing for the detection of weak target signals. The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated and measured underwater signals, clearly illustrating the better performance of the proposed method.

"Hyperspectral Image Classification on Large-Scale Agricultural Crops: The Heilongjiang Benchmark Dataset, Validation Procedure, and Baseline Results","Over the past few decades, researchers have shown sustained and robust investment in exploring methods for hyperspectral image classification (HSIC). The utilization of hyperspectral imagery (HSI) for crop classification in agricultural areas has been widely demonstrated for its feasibility, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. However, numerous coexisting issues in agricultural scenarios, such as limited annotated samples, uneven distribution of crops, and mixed cropping, could not be explored insightfully in the mainstream datasets. The limitations within these impractical datasets have severely restricted the widespread application of HSIC methods in agricultural scenarios. A benchmark dataset named Heilongjiang (HLJ) for HSIC is introduced in this paper, which is designed for large-scale crop classification. For practical applications, the HLJ dataset covers a wide range of genuine agricultural regions in Heilongjiang Province; it provides rich spectral diversity enriched through two images from diverse time periods and vast geographical areas with intercropped multiple crops. Simultaneously, considering the urgent demand of deep learning models, the two images in the HLJ dataset have 319,685 and 318,942 annotated samples, along with 151 and 149 spectral bands, respectively. To validate the suitability of the HLJ dataset as a baseline dataset for HSIC, we employed eight classical classification models in fundamental experiments on the HLJ dataset. Most of the methods achieved an overall accuracy of more than 80% with 10% of the labeled samples used for training. Furthermore, the advantages of the HLJ dataset and the impact of real-world factors on experimental results are comprehensively elucidated. The comprehensive baseline experimental evaluation and analysis affirm the research potential of the HLJ dataset as a large-scale crop classification dataset.

The Influence of Reverse Yielding on the Plastic Conditioning of Interference Fits in Power Transmission Engineering,"Interference fits are very common shaft–hub connections due to their low manufacturing costs and excellent technical properties. The Plastic Conditioning of this machine element is a new and not very well-known method. During the development of this method, it was discovered that Reverse Yielding occurs in certain applications and has a negative impact on the result. This paper examines the effects of Reverse Yielding on the technology of Plastic Conditioning of interference fits in Power Transmission Engineering. Based on the Shear Stress Hypothesis (SH), the Plane Stress State (PSS), and the ideal plastic behavior of materials, established stress–mechanical relationships are used to find the influencing parameters of Reverse Yielding on the technology of Plastic Conditioning and their limits. As a result, a new computational concept is developed that allows the user to maximize Plastic Conditioning while avoiding Reverse Yielding.

Following the Writer’s Path to the Dynamically Coalescing Reactive Chains Design Pattern,"Two recent studies addressed the problem of reducing transitional turbulence in applications developed in C# on .NET. The first study investigated this problem in desktop and Web GUI applications and the second in virtual and augmented reality applications using the Unity3D game engine. The studies used similar solution approaches, but both were somewhat embedded in the details of their applications and implementation platforms. This paper examines these two families of applications and seeks to extract the common aspects of their problem definitions and solution approaches and codify the problem-solution pair as a new software design pattern. To do so, the paper adopts Wellhausen and Fiesser’s writer’s path methodology and follows it systematically to discover and write the pattern, recording the reasoning at each step. To evaluate the pattern, the paper applies it to an arbitrary C#/.NET GUI application. The resulting design pattern is named Dynamically Coalescing Reactive Chains (DCRC). It enables the approach to transitional turbulence reduction to be reused across a range of related applications, languages, and user interface technologies. The detailed example of the writer’s path can assist future pattern writers in navigating through the complications and subtleties of the pattern-writing process.

The matrix pseudoinverses are replaced by FO-ZNN outputs, which solves the problem of accuracy degradation in the traditional pseudoinverse steering laws due to the complexity of matrix pseudoinverse operations under high dynamics conditions. In addition, the convergence and robustness of the FO-ZNN are proven. The results show that the proposed FO-ZNN converges faster than the traditional zeroing neural network under external disturbances. Finally, a new weighting function containing rotor deflection angles is added to the steering law to ensure that the saturation of the rotor deflection angles can be avoided. Semi-physical simulation results demonstrate the correctness and superiority of the proposed method.

"Empowering Undergraduate Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine: Exploring Experiences, Fostering Motivation, and Advancing Gender Equity","The representation and success of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) have sparked discussions, given their underrepresentation in these traditionally male-dominated fields. While women comprise 40% of STEMM undergraduates, senior-level positions see this figure drop below 20%. Research suggests that gender disparities in STEMM participation result from motivational differences, rather than competence. Exploring the reasons for these disparities are important as they can have significant consequences for the acknowledgement of women in STEMM, the maintenance of their STEMM discipline, and future careers. As such, this study explored how the experiences of 13 female undergraduates in Australian STEMM programs impacted their motivation and persistence in their degree. Through face-to-face semi-structured interviews, analysed via reflexive thematic analysis, five themes were constructed, encapsulating diverse experiences shaping female undergraduates in STEMM, influencing self-efficacy, determination, and well-being. Early exposure and environment were pivotal, acting as motivators or deterrents. Additionally, peer support was suggested as being crucial, fostering belongingness in the male-dominated space. Participants also grappled with recognition challenges, influenced by gender imbalances and a lack of role models. Intimidation was evident, leading to thoughts of dropping out, but passion drove persistence amid these challenges. The research increases awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by female undergraduates in STEMM, offering valuable insights for developing strategies to enhance their university experiences and promote success in future STEMM careers.

Study on the Emission Characteristics of Typical City Buses under Actual Road Conditions,"Five typical in-use city buses in Tangshan with different emission standards, fuel power types, and emission control technology routes were selected as the research objects. PEMSs (Portable Emissions Measurement Systems) and OBD (On-Board Diagnostic) remote monitoring technologies were used to conduct research on actual road conditions and emission characteristics. The research aimed to analyze the driving characteristics of different power types of bus engines and after-treatment systems, as well as their impact on emissions. The results indicated that the actual road driving is mainly in the urban and suburban areas of the local region. Additionally, the VSP (Vehicle Specific Power) was found to be distributed in the low- and medium-speed range of mode Bin0~Bin24. The emission rates of each pollutant showed an increasing trend with the increase in VSP. THC and NOx emissions of CNG and LNG buses are significantly higher than those of gas–electric hybrid buses. However, the PM emissions are lower. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the NOx emission control of CNG and LNG buses. With the improvement in emission standards and the use of hybrid technology, CO2 and NOx emissions of China IV buses can be reduced by 13% and 53.5% compared with China III buses of the same tonnage. The CO2 and NOx emissions of China V buses using natural gas combustion and an electric mixture are 20% and 18.8% lower than those of China V buses of the same tonnage using only natural gas. In the actual operation of the diesel–electric hybrid bus equipped with the SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) system, the working time of the engine is about 35.5 ± 5%, and the working time of the SCR system only accounts for 65.5 ± 12%. The low working conditions of the SCR system and the low temperature of SCR system are the reasons for the high NOx concentration at the rear end of the SCR system when the hybrid electric bus is running at low speeds.

"Convective Drying of Apple Enhanced with Microwaves and Ultrasound—Process Kinetics, Energy Consumption, and Product Quality Approach","This research explores the drying kinetics of apples, evaluating the impact of convective drying (CV), ultrasonically assisted convective drying (CVUS), and convective–microwave processes (CVMW1 and CVMW2) on energy consumption, drying time, temperature profiles, and product quality. Ultrasound-assisted convective drying (CVUS) exhibited a 10% reduction in drying time and a distinct “heating effect”. Convective–microwave processes (CVMW1 and CVMW2) significantly reduced drying times (47% and 66%, respectively, compared to CV), raising concerns about potential deteriorative processes due to elevated temperatures. Numerical analysis, using the Midilli–Kucuk model, highlighted its robust fit and emphasized the influence of microwave and ultrasound on the effective diffusion coefficient. Quality assessment indicated enhancements in polyphenolic compounds, particularly in convective–microwave processes. The convective–microwave process at higher power (CVMW2) emerged as a balanced option, displaying improved kinetics, energy efficiency, and product quality. The findings underscore the potential of judiciously applying microwave and ultrasound technologies for significant energy reduction and process enhancement, with a recommendation for further exploration of new parameters. This study emphasizes the importance of considering both drying kinetics and product quality in evaluating drying processes for fruits and vegetables, providing valuable insights for industrial applications.

Low-Temperature Calcium Phosphate Ceramics Can Modulate Monocytes and Macrophages Inflammatory Response In Vitro,"Creating bioactive materials for bone tissue regeneration and augmentation remains a pertinent challenge. One of the most promising and rapidly advancing approaches involves the use of low-temperature ceramics that closely mimic the natural composition of the extracellular matrix of native bone tissue, such as Hydroxyapatite (HAp) and its phase precursors (Dicalcium Phosphate Dihydrate—DCPD, Octacalcium Phosphate—OCP, etc.). However, despite significant scientific interest, the current knowledge and understanding remain limited regarding the impact of these ceramics not only on reparative histogenesis processes but also on the immunostimulation and initiation of local aseptic inflammation leading to material rejection. Using the stable cell models of monocyte-like (THP-1ATRA) and macrophage-like (THP-1PMA) cells under the conditions of LPS-induced model inflammation in vitro, the influence of DCPD, OCP, and HAp on cell viability, ROS and intracellular NO production, phagocytosis, and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines was assessed. The results demonstrate that all investigated ceramic particles exhibit biological activity toward human macrophage and monocyte cells in vitro, potentially providing conditions necessary for bone tissue restoration/regeneration in the peri-implant environment in vivo. Among the studied ceramics, DCPD appears to be the most preferable for implantation in patients with latent inflammation or unpredictable immune status, as this ceramic had the most favorable overall impact on the investigated cellular models.

Tailoring the Techno-Functional Properties of Fava Bean Protein Isolates: A Comparative Evaluation of Ultrasonication and Pulsed Electric Field Treatments,"The fava bean protein isolate (FBPI) holds promise as a sustainable plant-based protein ingredient. However, native FBPIs exhibit limited functionality, including unsuitable emulsifying activities and a low solubility at a neutral pH, restricting their applications. This study is focused on the effect of ultrasonication (US) and pulsed electric fields (PEF) on modulating the techno-functional properties of FBPIs. Native FBPIs were treated with US at amplitudes of 60–90% for 30 min in 0.5 s on-and-off cycles and with PEF at an electric field intensity of 1.5 kV/cm with 1000–4000 pulses of 20 μs pulse widths. US caused a reduction in the size and charge of the FBPIs more prominently than the PEF. Protein characterization by means of SDS-PAGE illustrated that US and PEF caused severe-to-moderate changes in the molecular weight of the FBPIs. In addition, a spectroscopic analysis using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and circular dichroism (CD) revealed that US and the PEF induced conformational changes through partial unfolding and secondary structure remodeling from an α-helix to a β-sheet. Crystallographic and calorimetric determinations indicated decreased crystallinity and lowered thermal transition temperatures of the US- and PEF-modified FBPIs. Overall, non-thermal processing provided an effective strategy for upgrading FBPIs’ functionality, with implications for developing competitive plant-based protein alternatives.

Porous Organic Materials in Tissue Engineering: Recent Advances and Applications for Severed Facial Nerve Injury Repair,"The prevalence of facial nerve injury is substantial, and the restoration of its structure and function remains a significant challenge. Autologous nerve transplantation is a common treatment for severed facial nerve injury; however, it has great limitations. Therefore, there is an urgent need for clinical repair methods that can rival it. Tissue engineering nerve conduits are usually composed of scaffolds, cells and neurofactors. Tissue engineering is regarded as a promising method for facial nerve regeneration. Among different factors, the porous nerve conduit made of organic materials, which has high porosity and biocompatibility, plays an indispensable role. This review introduces facial nerve injury and the existing treatment methods and discusses the necessity of the application of porous nerve conduit. We focus on the application of porous organic polymer materials from production technology and material classification and summarize the necessity and research progress of these in repairing severed facial nerve injury, which is relatively rare in the existing articles. This review provides a theoretical basis for further research into and clinical interventions on facial nerve injury and has certain guiding significance for the development of new materials.

Roles of Urban Green Spaces for Children in High-Density Metropolitan Areas during Pandemics: A Systematic Literature Review,"For children living in one of the 30 megacities around the world, green spaces may be far away or tokenistic, with growing accounts of youth exhibiting a variety of nature deficit disorders. Amidst increasing pressure for more high-density metropolitan areas (HDMAs), international advocacy agencies are calling for policy makers and service providers to ensure good quality urban green spaces (UGSs) for all children. Furthermore, these green spaces need to be purposefully designed to cater to children’s needs, which continue to evolve amidst extreme weather such as heat waves. Recently, pandemics have placed additional constraints on how far children can travel and their time spent outdoors, making the quality of this experience for children even more important. This systematic literature review explored the roles of HDMA-UGSs for children during pandemics. From 551 studies retrieved and curated using the PRISMA methodology, 40 papers were subsequently thematically analysed. Four roles were synthesised for HDMA-UGSs in supporting children’s experiences during pandemics, which also benefit children during ‘normal’ day-to-day life’: (1) sustaining growth and development, (2) bridging social stratifications, (3) encouraging self-agency, and (4) facilitating independent mobility. Thirteen principles were distilled to support decision making in enabling these outcomes in new-build and refurbishment projects. The results are of immediate use for decision makers who are responsible for HDMA-UGS planning, procurement, installation, and maintenance. The UGS role descriptions enable targeted design interventions for supporting children’s health and well-being, including during times of constrained outdoor time.

Multiplexed Imaging Mass Cytometry Analysis in Preclinical Models of Pancreatic Cancer,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers. PDAC is characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME), that plays a pivotal role in disease progression and resistance to therapy. Investigating the spatial distribution and interaction of TME cells with the tumor is the basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying disease progression and represents a current challenge in PDAC research. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) is the major multiplex imaging technology for the spatial analysis of tumor heterogeneity. However, there is a dearth of reports of multiplexed IMC panels for different preclinical mouse models, including pancreatic cancer. We addressed this gap by utilizing two preclinical models of PDAC: the genetically engineered, bearing KRAS–TP53 mutations in pancreatic cells, and the orthotopic, and developed a 28–marker panel for single–cell IMC analysis to assess the abundance, distribution and phenotypes of cells involved in PDAC progression and their reciprocal functional interactions. Herein, we provide an unprecedented definition of the distribution of TME cells in PDAC and compare the diversity between transplanted and genetic disease models. The results obtained represent an important and customizable tool for unraveling the complexities of PDAC and deciphering the mechanisms behind therapy resistance.

Exploring the Environmental and Performance Implications of Utilizing Waste Swine Oil Biodiesel in CI Engines,"This study investigates the effects of varying waste swine oil biodiesel blends on the emission characteristics and efficiency of a compression ignition (CI) engine. Through a series of controlled experiments, the engine was operated under a constant load of 25% across different speeds ranging from 1200 to 1800 rpm. This study meticulously recorded the emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM), along with performance metrics, including Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) and Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE). The results revealed a clear inverse relationship between biodiesel blend percentage and emissions of CO, HC, and PM. CO emissions decreased from 0.76 at 1200 rpm to 0.22 at 1800 rpm for the B80 blend, compared to pure diesel. Similarly, HC emissions showed a decline from 36 to 20 for the B80 blend. Conversely, CO2 and NOx emissions increased in higher biodiesel blends, with CO2 peaking at 2.9 for the B80 blend and NOx emissions rising from 103 for pure diesel to 165 for the B80 blend. PM emissions also decreased with higher blends, from 15 in pure diesel to 10 in the B80 blend. This comprehensive analysis reveals that while biodiesel significantly reduces specific emissions, it also poses challenges in terms of increased fuel consumption and reduced thermal efficiency. The findings emphasize the need for advanced engine technologies and optimization strategies to harness the full potential of biodiesel as a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to diesel.

Pufferfish Optimization Algorithm: A New Bio-Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithm for Solving Optimization Problems,"A new bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithm named the Pufferfish Optimization Algorithm (POA), that imitates the natural behavior of pufferfish in nature, is introduced in this paper. The fundamental inspiration of POA is adapted from the defense mechanism of pufferfish against predators. In this defense mechanism, by filling its elastic stomach with water, the pufferfish becomes a spherical ball with pointed spines, and as a result, the hungry predator escapes from this threat. The POA theory is stated and then mathematically modeled in two phases: (i) exploration based on the simulation of a predator’s attack on a pufferfish and (ii) exploitation based on the simulation of a predator’s escape from spiny spherical pufferfish. The performance of POA is evaluated in handling the CEC 2017 test suite for problem dimensions equal to 10, 30, 50, and 100. The optimization results show that POA has achieved an effective solution with the appropriate ability in exploration, exploitation, and the balance between them during the search process. The quality of POA in the optimization process is compared with the performance of twelve well-known metaheuristic algorithms. The simulation results show that POA provides superior performance by achieving better results in most of the benchmark functions in order to solve the CEC 2017 test suite compared to competitor algorithms. Also, the effectiveness of POA to handle optimization tasks in real-world applications is evaluated on twenty-two constrained optimization problems from the CEC 2011 test suite and four engineering design problems. Simulation results show that POA provides effective performance in handling real-world applications by achieving better solutions compared to competitor algorithms.

Self-Assembled Monolayers of Push–Pull Chromophores as Active Layers and Their Applications,"In recent decades, considerable attention has been focused on the design and development of surfaces with defined or tunable properties for a wide range of applications and fields. To this end, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of organic compounds offer a unique and straightforward route of modifying and engineering the surface properties of any substrate. Thus, alkane-based self-assembled monolayers constitute one of the most extensively studied organic thin-film nanomaterials, which have found wide applications in antifouling surfaces, the control of wettability or cell adhesion, sensors, optical devices, corrosion protection, and organic electronics, among many other applications, some of which have led to their technological transfer to industry. Nevertheless, recently, aromatic-based SAMs have gained importance as functional components, particularly in molecular electronics, bioelectronics, sensors, etc., due to their intrinsic electrical conductivity and optical properties, opening up new perspectives in these fields. However, some key issues affecting device performance still need to be resolved to ensure their full use and access to novel functionalities such as memory, sensors, or active layers in optoelectronic devices. In this context, we will present herein recent advances in π-conjugated systems-based self-assembled monolayers (e.g., push–pull chromophores) as active layers and their applications.

Transitioning to Success: The Link between E-CTE and College Preparation for Students with Learning Disabilities in the United States,"In recent years, there has been a specific call to not only increase the number of engineering-trained individuals but also to address the lack of diversity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, including individuals with disabilities. In particular, students with learning disabilities (SWLDs) make up a large portion of all students and are, therefore, a crucial population on which to focus educational and career progression efforts. One potential means of promoting persistence along the STEM pipeline—engineering specifically—is through engineering career and technical education (E-CTE) coursework in high school. Using a nationally representative dataset, we explore how E-CTE participation links to college preparation and transition activities for SWLDs, including math SAT performance, dual credit course participation, college application, and FAFSA completion. Under our more rigorous school fixed-effects models, we find that E-CTE participation is associated with beneficial results across each of our outcomes. The implications are discussed.

"Comprehensive Investigation of Hardness, Wear and Frictional Force in Powder Metallurgy Engineered Ti-6Al-4V-SiCp Metal Matrix Composites","Metal matrix composites (MMCs) have achieved significant attention in engineering applications because of their exceptional properties, like increased strength-to-weight ratiosand resistance to wear. However, their manufacturing processes pose challenges for industries, such as oxidation, porosity, and chemical reactions. To address these challenges, this study investigates the processing and sintering (500 °C) of Ti-6Al-4V-SiCp composites and their mechanical properties, particularly hardness, wear and frictional force using a statistical approach. The main objective of this research is to identify optimal processing conditions for Ti-6Al-4V-SiCp composites that yield maximum hardness, minimal wear and frictional force. Thisstudy varies three key parameters, namely compaction pressure (Ton/sq.inch), SiC (wt.%), and PVA binder (wt.%) using Taguchi’s design of experiments (TDOE). Further, the response surface methodology (RSM) is used to develop second-order models to predict the output values under different processing conditions, by correlating with the values obtained from TDOE. The results indicate that the most significant influence on the output is exerted by SiC (wt.%), followed by PVA binder (wt.%) and compaction pressure (Ton/sq.inch). To achieve higher hardness with minimal wear and frictional force during processing, SiCp (15 wt.%), compaction pressure (4 Ton/sq.inch), and PVA binder (3 wt.%) arerecommended. Finally, microstructural analysis using (SEM) scanning electron microscope images, optical macrographs and (AFM) atomic force microscopy revealed that the inclusion of 15 wt.% SiCp resulted in improved hardness, wear and frictional force compared to 20 wt.% SiCp. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into optimizing the processing parameters of Ti-6Al-4V-SiCp samples, enabling the production of materials with enhanced hardness and wear resistance.

Optimizing Coverage in Wireless Sensor Networks: A Binary Ant Colony Algorithm with Hill Climbing,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play a vital role in various fields, but ensuring optimal coverage poses a significant challenge due to the limited energy resources that constrain sensor nodes. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel approach that combines the binary ant colony algorithm (BACA), a variant of ant colony optimization (ACO), with other search optimization algorithms, such as hill climbing (HC) and simulated annealing (SA). The BACA is employed to generate an initial solution by emulating the foraging behavior of ants and the pheromone trails they leave behind in their search for food. However, we acknowledge that the BACA alone may not guarantee the most optimal solution. Subsequently, HC and SA are optimization search algorithms that refine the initial solution obtained by the BACA to find a more enhanced solution. Through extensive simulations and experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed approach results in enhanced coverage and energy-efficient coverage in a two-dimensional (2D) field. Interestingly, our findings reveal that HC consistently outperforms SA, particularly in less complex search spaces, leveraging its robust exploitation approach. Our research contributes valuable insights into optimizing WSN coverage, highlighting the superiority of HC in this context. Finally, we outline promising future research directions that can advance the optimization of WSN coverage.
