      "             The last few decades have seen growing interest in the field of disciplinary aesthetics. While the physical sciences and mathematics have attracted significant interest in this area, relatively little attention has been given to the aesthetic potential of learning about the structure of one’s own native language. Within this paper, we bring together ideas from evolutionary aesthetics, philosophy, psychology and neuroscience to explore the question of what might characterize an aesthetics of grammar learning. The paper connects our previous empirical findings with theoretical developments across these disciplines. We argue that explicit grammar learning has a particular potential to evoke aesthetic experience due to its role as a mediator between procedural and declarative knowledge. We suggest that by facilitating the transformation from knowhow to knowledge, grammar learning has the potential to generate cognitive consonance, experienced as an aesthetic-epistemic feeling of fittingness. The discussion draws parallels between the characteristics of grammar and the properties of entities more traditionally conceived to be aesthetic (such as art works and performances). In particular, we note that meta-linguistic labels (grammar terms) provide concrete tokens which facilitate virtual models, supporting the transition from ‘automatism’ to ‘conscious reflection’. The paper concludes by exploring the implications for the field of disciplinary aesthetics and for developing pedagogies which maximize the aesthetic potential of grammar.\n",

      "             BackgroundUsing virtual patients, facilitated by natural language processing, provides a valuable educational experience for learners. Generating a large, varied sample of realistic and appropriate responses for virtual patients is challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI) programs can be a viable source for these responses, but their utility for this purpose has not been explored.\n",
      "            ObjectiveIn this study, we explored the effectiveness of generative AI (ChatGPT) in developing realistic virtual standardized patient dialogues to teach prenatal counseling skills.\n",
      "            MethodsChatGPT was prompted to generate a list of common areas of concern and questions that families expecting preterm delivery at 24 weeks gestation might ask during prenatal counseling. ChatGPT was then prompted to generate 2 role-plays with dialogues between a parent expecting a potential preterm delivery at 24 weeks and their counseling physician using each of the example questions. The prompt was repeated for 2 unique role-plays: one parent was characterized as anxious and the other as having low trust in the medical system. Role-play scripts were exported verbatim and independently reviewed by 2 neonatologists with experience in prenatal counseling, using a scale of 1-5 on realism, appropriateness, and utility for virtual standardized patient responses.\n",
      "            ResultsChatGPT generated 7 areas of concern, with 35 example questions used to generate role-plays. The 35 role-play transcripts generated 176 unique parent responses (median 5, IQR 4-6, per role-play) with 268 unique sentences. Expert review identified 117 (65%) of the 176 responses as indicating an emotion, either directly or indirectly. Approximately half (98/176, 56%) of the responses had 2 or more sentences, and half (88/176, 50%) included at least 1 question. More than half (104/176, 58%) of the responses from role-played parent characters described a feeling, such as being scared, worried, or concerned. The role-plays of parents with low trust in the medical system generated many unique sentences (n=50). Most of the sentences in the responses were found to be reasonably realistic (214/268, 80%), appropriate for variable prenatal counseling conversation paths (233/268, 87%), and usable without more than a minimal modification in a virtual patient program (169/268, 63%).\n",
      "            ConclusionsGenerative AI programs, such as ChatGPT, may provide a viable source of training materials to expand virtual patient programs, with careful attention to the concerns and questions of patients and families. Given the potential for unrealistic or inappropriate statements and questions, an expert should review AI chat outputs before deploying them in an educational program.\n",

      "             Even though receiving newcomer pupils in schools is not a new phenomenon, many education systems grapple with finding adequate schooling arrangements that foster belonging and inclusion. Over the years, policy-makers and school practitioners seem to echo recurring dilemmas in terms of what language support models may promote optimal inclusion, and whether and how to support the language of schooling while also building on students’ cultural and linguistic repertoires. In this article, we present classroom observations from two Austrian primary schools that implemented German language support in two distinct ways. School 1 implemented pull-out classes, whereas School 2 used a model of individualized learning for all students in the mainstream classroom. Utilizing the cultural-linguistic aspects of ‘belonging’ in pedagogical enactments, we analyze how teachers’ instructional strategies to organize curricular learning for newly arrived migrant pupils set conditions for pedagogies of (un)belonging in the classroom. Findings show that pedagogies of (un)belonging seemed to be formed via chains of patterned interactions, activities and utterances based on three key logics: marking students’ ‘fitness’ to the mainstream classroom, creating cultural (in)visibility, and as creating language hierarchies. While the two classroom practices remarkably differed in how they enabled German language learning and fitting to mainstream pedagogical norms, both seemed to uphold monolingualism and monoculturalism. Recommendations are given in order to expand narrow notions of belonging in educational policy and practice.\n",

      "             The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine, potentially leading to substantial advancements such as improved diagnostics, has been of increasing scientific and societal interest in recent years. However, the use of AI raises new ethical challenges, such as an increased risk of bias and potential discrimination against patients, as well as misdiagnoses potentially leading to over- or underdiagnosis with substantial consequences for patients. Recognizing these challenges, current research underscores the importance of integrating AI ethics into medical education. This viewpoint paper aims to introduce a comprehensive set of ethical principles for teaching AI ethics in medical education. This dynamic and principle-based approach is designed to be adaptive and comprehensive, addressing not only the current but also emerging ethical challenges associated with the use of AI in medicine. This study conducts a theoretical analysis of the current academic discourse on AI ethics in medical education, identifying potential gaps and limitations. The inherent interconnectivity and interdisciplinary nature of these anticipated challenges are illustrated through a focused discussion on “informed consent” in the context of AI in medicine and medical education. This paper proposes a principle-based approach to AI ethics education, building on the 4 principles of medical ethics—autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice—and extending them by integrating 3 public health ethics principles—efficiency, common good orientation, and proportionality. The principle-based approach to teaching AI ethics in medical education proposed in this study offers a foundational framework for addressing the anticipated ethical challenges of using AI in medicine, recommended in the current academic discourse. By incorporating the 3 principles of public health ethics, this principle-based approach ensures that medical ethics education remains relevant and responsive to the dynamic landscape of AI integration in medicine. As the advancement of AI technologies in medicine is expected to increase, medical ethics education must adapt and evolve accordingly. The proposed principle-based approach for teaching AI ethics in medical education provides an important foundation to ensure that future medical professionals are not only aware of the ethical dimensions of AI in medicine but also equipped to make informed ethical decisions in their practice. Future research is required to develop problem-based and competency-oriented learning objectives and educational content for the proposed principle-based approach to teaching AI ethics in medical education.\n",

      "             Writing is a central yet under-researched activity in teacher education classrooms. In this study, we explore in-class writing activities used by a multidisciplinary group of teacher educators at one teacher education institution. The purpose is to gain a better understanding of the nature of the writing activities and perspectives on writing they reflect. To this end, we analyze writing prompts and fieldnotes from classroom observations of fifteen literacy events in which writing was at the center. While our analysis reveals multiple and overlapping perspectives on writing, it also shows that writing activities are understood primarily as versatile learning tools. This is reflected in a focus on cross-disciplinary uses of writing to enhance students’ content learning, rather than on explicit development of discipline-specific writing conventions. Furthermore, our analysis shows that there is limited metacommunication about the writing that takes place in the literacy events. We suggest that there is untapped potential among these teacher educators when it comes to making the pedagogical rationales behind the use of in-class writing activities explicit to the students. Such explicit rationales might support students in developing a greater understanding of how to use and work with writing as future teachers.\n",

      "             IntroductionThis study delves into the reality and challenges associated with teaching Saudi Arabian Sign Language (SASL) to hearing students within the context of regular schools.MethodsA descriptive survey methodology was employed, utilizing a researcher-developed questionnaire. The sample comprised 148 participants, including 94 male and 54 female fifth- and sixth-grade students from Alshams Private School in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.ResultsThe investigation unveiled various obstacles in SASL instruction, encompassing the absence of Deaf sign language teachers, limited availability of diverse levels or courses for sign language education, occasional student embarrassment, and challenges related to the learning environment and resources. Gender-based differences were observed, with female students exhibiting a more positive outlook on the feasibility of SASL instruction. However, no gender-based distinctions were evident concerning perceived obstacles or overall questionnaire responses. Additionally, no significant differences emerged between fifth- and sixth-grade students in their perceptions of obstacles or questionnaire responses.DiscussionThe findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and student perceptions associated with SASL instruction in Saudi Arabian schools. Notably, the study provides a foundation for further research and potential improvements in sign language education.\n",

      "             A troubling misconception exists that high-ability is enough to ensure positive educational, mental health and well-being outcomes for gifted students. Of course, we want all our students to develop their potential in school, so why are so many of our more able children failing in school and enduring the repercussions of reduced well-being? The notion that a student is not highly able if they are receiving poor grades is a common societal misconception, and this is commonly the case for gifted learners with disability, also known as twice-exceptional students. A considerable number of school students globally have intellectual ability in the gifted range, a high number of those are gifted with co-occurring disability, and many remain unidentified. It is, therefore, likely that a significant percentage of our classrooms have students who may be flying under the radar and are likely to be underachieving or unsupported within the school system. The purpose of this article is to highlight the issues around gifted students with disability that may contribute to their underachievement. Also discussed is how educators, counsellors and other key stakeholders can support this unique population of students.\n",

      "             COVID-19 laid bare many failings and shortcomings of state systems, institutions and structures which aim to protect citizens against harm. As observed from the outcomes of the pandemic in many parts of the Global South and Global North, the resilience of health, social protection, governance, economic, education, and social welfare systems has been significantly eroded or challenged, leaving large segments of the population open to heightened risk and vulnerability. This has been noted to have significantly eroded social capital, namely the trust, communication, and dialogue between citizens in the state as well as citizens with each other. Based on comparative research carried out on the return to schooling process in five countries, Lebanon, Nigeria, Colombia, Georgia, and Zambia, the paper highlights the important role and function that educational governance, decision-making, and control throughout the pandemic has played a key role in either maintaining or erode social capital, and ultimately the resilience of the entire education system. Much of this was based on how well state officials and local education officials both considered and communicated their actions to educators, students and their families. The importance of education as a site where both bridging and linking social capital is both strengthened, but also capitalized on is also discussed. Specifically, the paper highlights, using the example of COVID-19 education responses, how a state that is responsive and accountable to its citizenry in a time of crisis, stands the greatest chance of ensuring such periods do not lead to an erosion of social capital.\n",

      "             This research investigates the potential of Lesson Study to develop teachers’ professional community. Situated in two case study schools, Doone and Crannog (both pseudonyms), where mathematics teachers participated in multiple, successive cycles of Lesson Study over the course of one academic year, the research details the development of teacher community through teachers’ conversations and reflections. Data was generated through audio recordings of teachers’ Lesson Study meetings and individual interviews with participating teachers. Analysis is based on a framework of professional teacher community which describes discrete phases of development from beginning to mature. Findings from the research suggest that groups of teachers may begin their Lesson Study work at different stages of evolution of teacher community and that Lesson Study has the potential to strength and develop such community over successive cycles. The research demonstrates that teachers’ participation in Lesson Study can provide them with opportunities to recognize and express communal responsibility for individual growth of colleagues, a key feature in the formation of teacher community. The research also highlights the importance of navigating fault lines or differences in ideas and opinions during the Lesson Study work. Findings may offer guidance to facilitators of Lesson Study on elements of teachers’ collaborative work which may benefit from additional focus, such as productively engaging with conflict within a group. This research contributes to the literature on Lesson Study in outlining how this model of professional development may provide a powerful structure within which teacher community can be developed.\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Call center agents work in a telephone call center where they receive calls from customers inquiring about a product or service and make outgoing calls to current and potential customers. They must assist customers in a variety of areas, including billing, service issues, and orders, log calls made or received, and enter customer data into a specialized database. Additional responsibilities, such as sales and customer retention, are performed on a computer at a workstation or cubicle by agents in a call center. The majority of the work utilizes computers, software applications, and the internet. They are essential to the existence of all of these call centers. The issue at hand is whether there are labor productivity trade-offs and whether human labor has been replaced by technology. In light of this, this paper will discuss the factors that contribute to the labor productivity of call center agents in Metro Manila, resulting in an increase in employment despite the reliance on technology. Others believed that technological progress paved the way for the replacement of human labor, thereby decreasing the number of employed people or increasing unemployment. Unobserved in the paper's findings was a direct relationship between an increase in labor productivity and a rise in unemployment. In this study, the authors employed qualitative research characteristics, such as the relationship between researcher and participant. Qualitative research always gathers verbal and open-ended information. Former students of UDM's Marketing course, the participants are currently employed in Metro Manila as marketers. In this paper, agents from a call center demonstrated that human labor is still the master of technology and that their efforts are required to produce more output and services. Labor productivity equals the sum of human labor or labor resources, technological innovation, and capital expenditures.\",\n",

The researcher used a descriptive method for the research, to gather information about the present existing condition. The researcher decided to use the sampling technique by selecting at least 250 students as respondents. The respondents' demographic profile comprises the following: age, gender and college year level. The sampling techniques are non-probability sampling techniques used when respondents are chosen because of their appropriateness in the conduct of a study. This is designed to have general description of the effectiveness of electronic wallets as an alternative cash transaction for Quezon city university entrepreneurship students. The researcher used systematic random sampling for Quezon city university entrepreneurship students who have been into online classes. The gathered data from respondents were tabulated and interpreted. The main instrument used in the collection of data was a structured google form survey questionnaire. The questionnaire was a pattern up to the questions used in a relevant study. The questionnaire was formulated based on the related literature gathered. The instrument was divided into three (3) parts. The first part depicts the demographic profile of the respondents which includes their age, sex and year level. The second part of the questionnaire is about the respondent's assessment of the effectiveness of electronic wallets as an alternative cash transaction for Quezon city university entrepreneurship students in the new normal.

The Philippines, according to The World Bank's 2014 report for the East Asia Region, has the highest absolute rate of maritime casualties, which is 40 % higher than Indonesia, which ranks second. According to World Bank data, 228 ships are involved in accidents and 303 people are killed annually in the Philippines. Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) reported in 2019 that the number of maritime accidents investigated increased from 2016 to 2019: 2016 43 cases, 2017 - 48 cases, 2018 -152 cases, and 2019-148 cases, for a total of 391. 273 of these incidents are classified as serious accidents. In order to promote safety aware- ness, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) mandated that all ship owners require all seafarers to complete the SOLAS program before joining the vessel. To evaluate the program, the CIPP model will be applied while surveying and collecting data from the three types of respondents: one administrative member of the Maritime Institute, two retired seafarers, and six active seafarers. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the SOLAS74 program's impact on the careers of seafarers and to propose a risk reduction management model to enhance the SOLAS program, which will ensure the protection of seafarers during pandemics at sea.\",\n",

Ugbo Street Food is one of the famous places in Tondo, Manila that offers numerous food stalls that serve inexpensive snacks and desserts until the late hours of the night. The goal of the study is to increase awareness towards health-related concerns associated with food safety and sanitation on eating street foods and to promote Ugbo Street food as one of the famous food destinations. 411 food aficionados completed a 39-likert type survey developed by the researchers. The instrument was validated by industry and food experts and has a Cronbach\\'s Alpha of 0.966. The customers rated sanitation of service area and equipment, food handling and customer service, and pest and waste man- agement of the food establishments in Ugbo, Tondo Manila to be \"very good\", especially on food visibility and equipment. Items on food preparation such as exposure, cooking, and han- dlers\\' sanitation practices ranked lowest. Significant differences (p<.05) were found in the as- sessment based on the respondents\\' frequency of visit, companions, amount spent, and edu- cational attainment. This shows that food safety and sanitation were not consistently prac- ticed.

       "  'abstract': \"Puerto Princesa City, Palawan is known for its tourism attractions from the time the Under- ground River was included in the seven wonders of nature around the world. The enormous in- crease of tourist visitors resulted in increa tourism-related businesses. Financial institutions start- ed to proliferate as well and it plays a very significant role in the tourism industry by providing fi- nancial services to tourism-related businesses. The study gathered data on the profile of tourism-related business in terms of its capital structure, management and employment. Likewise, data was also gathered to describe the profile of financial institutions in terms of classifications and products and services offered. The study was conducted to determine the economic link between tourism related businesses and financial institutions. It aimed to determine the opportunities and problems affecting the growth of the tourism related businesses and financial institutions. Moreover, it was conducted to determine how the products and services of the financial institutions help in the growth and development of tourism-related businesses. The study used purposive sampling with forty (40) respondents from tourism-related busi- nesses and fifteen (15) respondents from financial institutions. Survey questionnaire was used. The findings revealed that the increase of tourism-related businesses contribute to the development of the city in terms of employment. Moreover, it brought opportunities to financial institutions. Tourism-related businesses obtained its borrowings for its short term and long-term financing needs from banks and microfinance institutions. Banking institutions catered financial services to those who passed their standards while microfinance institutions catered to those who cannot pass the stringent qualifications of the bank. The existence of commercial banks was not really relevant to the development of eco-tourism business in the city as it is composed mostly of the micro and small businesses. Only one bank has offered a financial product designed to fit the current needs of the city for the recovery and development of its tourism sector. To be responsive to the needs of the city's eco-tourism industry, specifically tourism-related businesses in particular, a consultative process among various stakeholders composed of financial service providers, clients/users of financial services such as the tourism industry. government institutions, development partners and international organizations is needed to provide inputs and feedback, share knowledge, and come up with supports and initiatives such as helping the recovery and development of the city tourism through providing constant government intervention and financial service that is tailored fit to the needs of the tourism-related businesses.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"This action research reports the results of a classroom-based study conducted in general education courses to examine whether the integration of video recordings would contribute to the improvement of the oral communication skills of students. It also aims to find out what are the perceptions of students using video recording their online learning. twenty students enrolled in general courses participated in this study. To determine the effectiveness of video recording on the students' oral communication skills, the speaking test of IELTS was modified as pre- and post-test. In addition to the analysis of the scores assigned to the students by two raters using Cohen's kappa, an analysis of students' speaking in pre- and post-test was undertaken to determine whether measures of students' oral communication output differ as a result of the video recording. The results suggest that the incorporation of video recordings into the speaking activities did not have significant improvement in their oral communication skills. However, the analysis of the qualitative data showed that the students were able to apply those communication skills in speaking, and they have gained confidence and insights on how to improve their skills through the comments given by the researchers.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Local Universities and Colleges (LUCs), being dynamic organizations, need educational leaders who can effectively implement necessary changes for institutional development. Due to demands for reform and accountability, LUCs must meet strict educa- tional standards or face serious consequences. Schools must find leaders that are not just willing, but able to face these challenges by successfully initiating change both for the im- provement of the system as well as its ultimate reform. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) promotes Institutional Sustainability Assessment (ISA) because it can serve as a learning process for the HEIs and contribute to its continuing quality cycle for its institutional development. In response to the lack of informed research concerning educational leadership styles correlating to institutional sustainability assessment and outcomes in LUCs, the researcher is motivated to pursue this study and aims to contribute to this pressing issue of LUCS for quality mechanisms, despite of its high political influences and bureaucratic system that affect or hinder the LUCs development. Hence, the purpose of the study is to determine the situational leadership style of the individuals most responsible for changing or maintaining a system and what factors might affect the ability of a person to make meaningful changes in a school setting and the relationship of these leadership styles to ISA Key Results Areas. Descriptive method was used in the study using the Leadership Style Instrument adopt- ed from Hershey and Blanchard and the Self-Evaluation Document of the CHED ISA adminis- tered to the LUCs Administrative and Academic Heads, using random sampling technique. The study revealed that coaching, delegating, and directing are the leadership styles exhibited by the school administrators to a moderate extent in a situation. This implies that development level of the subordinates is still in low level. The sampled LUCS \\'very often practiced\" the institutional sustainability indicators, as a whole. And, it is only the directing leadership style that has a significant positive relationship with governance (r=.224, >:.05); quality of teaching and learning (r=.255, >;.05); and exposure, research and creative work (240, .05). This implies that the increase in the use of directing leadership style will also increase the practice of institutional sustainability such as governance; quality of teaching and learning; and exposure, research and creative work.',\n",

There are, however, observed consistent lower acceptable ratings like the individual monitoring of cleanliness and sanitation of comfort rooms, ramps and lifts for physically impaired children, drainage and sewage system, properly labeled and barcoded equipment, well-planned entrance and exit points of the building and facilities, and space provisions for adequate clinic size. The respondents likewise provided varying assessment of within the acceptable limits for their schools' current instructional support facilities. Nonetheless, found with least ratings but still acceptable include emergency showers, functional exhaust fans, designation of qualified and well-trained laboratory aides, readily available first-aid supplies in chemistry laboratories, provision of updated computers with operation manual and software applications with license in computer laboratories; provision of separate rooms for boys and girls, adequate Personal Protective Equipment, and first-aid supplies for the TLE rooms. This is diverse appreciation of schools compliance to the prescribed standards for school buildings and facilities, space provisions and safety, health, and well-being.

Several human factors contribute to the low academic performance of students in the Philippines who are currently studying in the new normal setup or online learning. According to Rotas & Cahapay (2020), one of the main challenges that students are currently facing in the online learning setup is the overloaded lesson activities. This particular difficulty of having to submit unjustified load activities from different subjects in just a week makes the students feel that the value of learning in the lesson is lost and they are just doing the activity for the sake of compliance. This is why this study aims to analyze how human factors contribute to the academic performance of the 3rd year BSAMT students of PhilSCA. The results of this study will be used to make the proposed recommendatory framework on how to mitigate the contributions of selected human factors to a student's academic performance.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"In response to the educational challenges brought by the pandemic, the Las Piñas National High School (LPNHS) Almanza initiated a collaborative project dubbed as SHARE (Stakeholders' Hands-on Assistance in Remote Learning Engagement). The effectiveness of Project SHARE in the delivery of educational services through Modular Distance Learning was determined through a mixed-method explanatory research design. This investigation in- volved Grade 7 parents, GPTA officers, teachers, and advisers of Grade 7 learners at LPNHS - Almanza for School Year 2021-2022. The participants were askedto answer a 25-item survey questionnaire (using a 4-point Likert scale which ranged from 1=not satisfied to 4-highly satisfied) about their perceptions on the effectiveness of project SHARE. Focus group discussions with students, teachers, and GPTA officers were conducted to describe further their experiences on modular distance learning. Interviews with parents were likewise conducted to gather feedbacks on their involvement in project SHARE. Quantitative data from the survey were analyzed using descriptive statistics (frequency, mean and standard deviation), while the narrative data were subjected to qualitative data analysis. The results showed that the respondents are highly satisfied with the delivery of educational services in Modular Distance Learning in terms of the distribution and retrieval of Self Learning Modules (Mean= 3.872) and Learning Activity Sheets (Mean=3.876). Respondents were satisfied with the parent-teacher conference and with the aspect of motivating and encouraging learners. Major themes emerged from the FGDs with the respondents like self-approval for learners' development, active partners in terms of education support, and increased community involvement in the aspect of continuing education. Findings revealed that project SHARE has made a significant contribution to the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation of students to study in spite of the COVID-19 epidemic. Furthermore, project SHARE underscored the positive effects of parents' and teachers' partnership and cooperation regarding the leamers' education, wherein a strong parent-teacher partnership boosts learner achievement. Therefore, schools should have more programs that will encourage parents to be actively involved with their children's education. \",\n",

Many colleges, instructors, and students at all levels have been affected by the inability to move quickly to electronic and online learning environments. The number of colleges and universities offering distance education programs increased significantly around the world, and distance education has exploded in many countries. According to Mykhaylova (2021), the crisis has affected more than 1.37 billion students. Students have been forced to move from physical college campuses and adapt to modern online educational environments as a result of the advantages and disadvantages. They experienced anxiety, isolation, and confu- sion about what will happen with their classes, tests, graduation, and other significant events affecting their academic course, such as platform usability problems, despite possible Covid- 19 virus health risks. However, the hassle of commuting to school has been eliminated, and having the freedom to learn anytime and having enough rest and sleep has been possible, as well as keeping safe at home from the Covid-19 virus. Traditionally, edu- cators used distance learning to incorporate various learning methods into their lesson plans. The Covid-19 pandemic has made online learning mandatory, pushing schools and universities to quickly implement unprecedented strategies in their attempts to make distance education accessible, including creating an immediate learning environment in a setting that is distinct from conventional classrooms. Therefore, the researchers would like to determine the perspective of BSIT students on online learning based on their experience during its implementation and also identify their preferences. To help Quezon City University take action for better management of facilitating online classes.

This paper is a comparative study of ethnic and national stereotypes and self-stereotypes of these three ethnolinguistic groups. Using a modified Katz and Braly trait checklist, as well as their uniformity index, this paper was able to: 1) determine the ethnic stereotypes of the said ethnolinguistic groups; 2) compare and contrast the uniformity as well as positivity of the three ethnic stereotypes; 3) determine the ethnic self-stereotypes of the same ethnolinguistic groups; 4) compare and contrast the uniformity as well as positivity of the three ethnic stereotypes with their corresponding ethnic self- stereotypes; 5) determine the national self-stereotypes of the three ethnolinguistic groups; and 6) compare and contrast the uniformity as well as positivity of the three national self-stereotypes with their corresponding ethnic self-stereotypes. This paper is significant in understanding the peaceful and productive co-existence of the said three ethnolinguistic groups not only in TSU but also in Tarlac City, and Tarlac Province.

This study assessed the practices and resilience of the institution's responses to the pandemic from the lens of employees of a state college in Northern Mindanao, Philippines as a basis for strategic actions. This study employed quantitative and qualitative research methods with survey questionnaires/google survey forms, focused group discussions, and key informant interviews to one hundred- four employees. Analysis of the practices and resilience among faculty revealed an increase in teaching responsibilities, professional advancement, and creative work and advising responsibilities but a decreased time spent responding to learners' and colleagues' emotional and mental health needs. Both administration and faculty felt somewhat stressed; however, their work-life balance has improved substantially. The faculty workload has decreased significantly, job satisfaction has decreased, and caregiving responsibilities have stayed the same. As to the administration, there was an increased in job satisfaction; the workload remained the same, and caregiving responsibilities decreased somewhat. Both found a moderate extent of access to information, availability of resources, COVID-19 accommodations, and work adjustments. Themes or scenarios for strategic actions emerged as follows: orienting the employees of the plans and activities of the college towards crises; capacitating faculty and employees; education continuity plan; relevant curriculum; upgrading infrastructure; full support to disaster risk reduction management system; monitoring, evaluation and assessment of on-going responses to strategic actions; and inclusion of well-being, equity and crises plan to strategic plans.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Employees are the most valuable asset in an organization. Their skills, abilities, experiences and knowledge are necessary for the company to achieve their mission and goals and to maintain their market performance. Batram and Gibson (2000) claim that, training can sometimes be costly if the programs do not successfully align and match the requirements of the organization and the needs of the employees. Thus, Training Needs Analysis (TNA) must be done in a systematic way, or an organization may incur a loss if the requirements assessment is a failure. The main purpose of this study was to assess the type of training and support needed for the Engineering Instructors at Quezon City University (QCU) for them to develop their personal competencies, knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA), and to be able for them to contribute to the university's organizational goals and mission. The researcher utilized descriptive method and a survey questionnaire was administered to assess the type of training and support needed for the Engineering Instructors at QCU. Statistical treatment was applied to analyze data accurately and precisely. The findings clearly revealed that the subjects that are least taught includes information system, Ergonomics 2, and Operation Research 2; while in ECE is feedback and control sys- tems. Furthermore, it is obvious that the instructors of industrial engineering possess the greatest level of technical expertise in the field of industrial organization and management. They did, however, have the lowest level of information system understanding. On the other hand, ECE Instructors has the most expertise in electromagnetics, while they are least expert in Signals, Spectra, and Signal Processing subjects. In addition, IE Instructors are most interested in training related to Industrial Materials and Processes, while ECE Instructors are most interested in Feedback and Control Systems topics. The University must consider providing budget for the most preferred seminars/training of the instructors and should give emphasis on subjects that got the least expertise such as Information Systems and Signals, Spectra, and Signal Processing. Moreover, it is recommended that the location of the training/ seminar is at Quezon City University and the management should hire an external consultant or training specialists thru active-hands on participation, instructor-led, or study groups.\",\n",

In an article written by Oshitha Narangoda (2022) for Shorelight, he stressed how universities and colleges all around the world emphasize the importance of theses and the implications that their creation entails and how they can be used to solve problems and contribute to the existing body of knowledge. Soni et al.

The Thesis Repository System will act as a one-stop location for storing and viewing thesis outputs made by the AMT student body. It can be accessed by the AMT students in order to help with the creation of their own thesis outputs. Not only will it store thesis outputs, but it will display and categorize them in a manner that would make sorting and searching easier and more fluid, exceeding the description of a basic storage system.',\n",

(2007), as cited by Saltz (2017), this research documented and assessed the crisis leadership competencies and pandemic response strategies of school leaders in the DepEd Division of Northern Samar. Utilizing a sequential exploratory approach, qualitative and quantitative designs were adopted. In the qualitative component, eight (8) school leaders participated in face-to-face interview sessions, wherein the emerging themes from their responses highlighted the concept that meta-leaders have a higher effect than their real authority because they exert a strong influence on their followers, aiding them in overcoming obstacles and seizing opportunities. They understood the nature and significance of the situation, and in order to keep a diverse group of people on track, they weaved together key themes that highlighted the organization\\'s core purpose and ambitions. In the qualitative aspect, the broader population of 130 respondents answered a questionnaire about school leaders and; crisis leadership competencies, which revealed the following results: \"Very High\" on Team Leader- ship (AWM -3.25); \"High\" on Situational Awareness and Integrative Thinking (AWM =3.18); and \"High\" on Decisiveness and Emotional Effectiveness (AWM 3.24). In addition, respondents completed a questionnaire regarding the extent of the school leaders pandemic response strategies, which revealed the following findings: Promoting Organizational Resili- ence, \"Large Extent\" (AWM =3.24); Acting with Integrity, \"Very Large Extent\" (AWM =3.29); and Exhibiting Learning Orientation, \"Large Extent (AWM =2.96). Based on the results, the researcher contends that when establishing a crisis management plan for a successful pan- demic response strategy, school leaders must prioritize the following elements: communication, high productivity, technology use, and accessibility. On the basis of these factors, the current researcher proposes the following three focus areas for the crisis management plan: (1) establishing guidelines or policies for remote work for faculty and staff; (2) embracing remote work for department heads, master teachers, and focal persons; and (3) developing inclusive and collaborative virtual meetings. The researcher also suggests that school administrators think about adopting the recommended crisis management plan to make sure that all important aspects of the school system are taken care of.',\n",

From this number, the majority of these Filipino children with disabilities were not able to go to school or sustain school participation. Challenges included financial constraints faced by households or lack of access to educational facilities. Of the 136,523 children with special needs enrolled in special classes, 66,635, or 48.81% had disabilities. This study explored the experiences of differently-abled learners from the perspectives of the parents, the teachers, and the learners with disabilities themselves applying the ableism lens. Discourse analysis design was utilized for this study wherein ten participants from the Department of Education Schools Division of Nueva Ecija and comprising of three parents of differently-abled learners, three learners with disabilities, and four teachers were selected via purposive sampling. Semi-structured interviews were the main data-gathering tool while thematic analysis was used in analyzing the data. Findings revealed the following major themes; (1) a struggle for acceptance, respect and equality; (2) reinforcing ableism by prescriptive and restrictive norms; (3) ableism in spoken word through labeling; and (4) confident and achieving versus individuals with low self-esteem. Inclusive education has come a long way although, there are some obstacles to inclusive education.

As the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of teleworking by employers, online employment opportunities have increased. Given that the scenario allows students to work while studying online, determining the number and extent of employed students is an important area of research. This study aims to document the employment profiles of undergraduate students of Quezon City University. A total of 7,050 responses were received during the survey period. According to the findings of the study, approximately 15% of the respondents are employed full- or part-time. At the time of the survey, 64% of the working students who responded in the survey are working on-site, while 24% are working from home. Meanwhile, 50% of these working students are extremely satisfied with their current employment situation, while 44% are somewhat satisfied. In general, the majority of the respondents who are working students are pleased with their current employment situa- tion. Despite the fact that only two out of ten respondents are working students, the school administration must still pay close attention to this issue. The development of policies that will assist these students is required. For future studies, it is also important to examine employ- ment patterns among undergraduates and how these patterns vary over time and based on student characteristics.',\n",

A supply chain is defined as \"a network of organizations that are involved, through upstream and downstream linkages in the different processes and activities that produce value in the form of products and services in the hand of the ultimate consumer (Christopher, 1998). Successful supply chains can significantly benefit the competitiveness of the firms. A supply chain may contain all activities that transform raw materials to final products and deliver them to the customers. A number of stages are involved in a supply chain, typically including suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, distribution centers, retailers, and customers. The material flows go through the supply chain from suppliers to customers, while the information flows of orders and demands are in an opposite direction. In today\\'s highly competitive and complex marketplace, a company with a more effective and efficient supply chain can have more advantage than its competitors. Thus, supply chain management, as a source of competitive advantage, has become a big challenge for the companies in different industries.

       "  'abstract': \"This collaborative action research was conducted in response to the need of developing a corrective and progressive mechanics to address the issues relating to the non-performing engineering students with the end goal to expand and accelerate the acquisition of knowledge. The study was conducted in Quezon City University Main Campus where participants are engineering students, members of the faculty who collaborated during the intervention program with the supervision of University Officials including the College Dean of Engineering, the area Chair Persons, and the Research Management Office. This research was participated by 68 respondents during the initial phase and 77 respondents during the intervention program. Subjects involved were science, technology, engineering and mathe- matics. The study further employed the binary coding techniques to comply with data privacy law and research ethical standards. Moreover, the study used the categorizing, describing, analyzing and interpreting techniques for qualitative data analysis. After analyzing the data, the following recommendations were here to present. 1.) In the outset of opening of classes, students should be reminded of the policy on absences. They should be informed about the conflicts of schedule to their subject teachers to address the issues and concerns in dropping the subject. As much as possible, they should ask proper advice of the area chairpersons and the college dean if there are conflicts of schedule to prevent the occurrence of officially dropped (OD), Unofficially dropped (UD), and to prevent failing grade due to excessive ab- sences. A truancy report is a good mechanism to monitor student's absences before they eventually end up to OD or UD situation. 2.) In the early stage during the opening of classes, students should be re-oriented about the three (3) factors that are associated in the learning process and the learning capacity of students. They should be oriented to review the importance and application of prerequisite subjects which are necessary to improve their knowledge, skills and development of positive attitude towards the study of Sciences and Mathematics. They should also be oriented to review their knowledge and skills in outlining the concept mapping which are essentials of topic sequencing and relating these to a more advanced study of Sciences and mathematics subjects. Moreover, students should be re-oriented about the importance of constant practice in problem solving and analysis. 3.) The College of Engineering may consciously advocate a student-centered classroom environment that promotes corrective and progressive mechanics for non-performing students, average performing students, and better performing students respectively. This strategy was proven by many collaborative researches to expedite transfer of knowledge, to propagate expansion of knowledge and to accelerate acquisition of knowledge and skills through innovative ways of learning by using learning apps and wireless educational technologies. 4.) A similar study is highly recommended to look for other factors associated in the learning process and learning capacity not only of the non performing students but even good performing students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics subjects. This is also to maintain high quality standards of Quezon City University Engineering students that may lead them to a globally competitive graduate and to be future leaders in national development.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology instructors and students can use the functional pipe rotator for oxyacetylene welding with Variable Frequency Drive to perform cutting operations using an oxyacetylene supply intended for black and galvanized iron pipes. This pipe rotator for oxyacetylene welding will support faculty and students at Cavite State University - CCAT campus' BS Industrial Technology program in mastering the basics and functionalities of a VFD-controlled chuck in holding pipes. Overall, the equipment can be effectively used in applicable machine shop operations that are stated in this study. The BS Stationary Marine Technology and allied field instructors and students, as well as future researchers who will utilize this study as a foundation to improve or perform relevant research, will also be the direct beneficiaries of this research. The pipe rotator for oxyacetylene welding will be of great use as the program offers topics related to the metal cutting process. The developed pipe rotator for oxyacetylene welding with VFD is operated by properly placing the metal pipe on the three-jaw chuck. This is followed by aligning the oxyacetylene torch holder at an appropriate distance from the metal pipe, turning on the circuit breaker, and plugging in the power source. The Start Button is then turned on and the speed of the Variable Frequency Drive is adjusted accordingly. The operator needs to monitor the rotation of the metal pipe and check the condition of the chuck and wheel support. After opening the oxyacetylene supply, constant monitoring of the overall operation is required. This prototype is designed mainly for instructional operations for stationary marine and allied field instructors to teach the students to perform different processes involving oxyacety- lene cutting, holding metal pipes, and holding the oxyacetylene torch.\",\n",

The design was proposed to be used in the field of welding and fabrication in which students can be more productive and effortlessly do their tasks in a short period of time. The proponents came up with the idea and design based on what they experience dur- ing laboratory activities. The previous booth that was created is only half and open and there is a risk of students getting hurt while they are watching, so we made the booth especially for one student/teacher only inside so that we can eliminate the risk of other students being in- jured. The proposed design focused on observing the students inside the booth while they are conducting welding activity, to have a good type of communication between the students and the instructor inside and outside, and also to train their skills on welding by using the welding positioner. It is considerably efficient and useful in comparison with the previous booth made here in welding and fabrication technology. As stated by the result of the evaluation test instrument presented to the respondents, a larger number gave a satisfactory rating that sympathizes that the proposed design was efficiently useful and justifiable.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"As a preventative move in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the country's educational system shifted from face-to-face engagement to online delivery. The adaptive transition necessitated that Quezon City University redesign its syllabus, learning materials, teaching techniques, student engagement, and assessment systems. The primary goal of the researchers is to conduct an evaluation of the Readings in Philippine History modules currently used at the Quezon City University to provide inputs for enhancing the module. This study used a descriptive method to evaluate the module utilized in the Readings in Philippine History course and to provide future directions for the instructional materials in a flexible learning environment. One hundred ninety-seven (197) students were asked to evaluate the module in terms of language, content, and format. On the other hand, nine (9) faculty members evaluated the module's language, content, format, objectives, presentation, and usefulness. According to the analysis conducted using SPSS version 22 statistical software, both teachers and students rated the modules as satisfactory overall. The t-test for independent samples revealed that there is no significant difference between the evaluations of teachers and students in the language, content, and format of the modules. Despite the fact that the evaluation suggests positive results, the feedback from the respondents showed that there are aspects of the module that can be improved. As a result, the module's content, presentation, and usefulness need to be revisited and improved. Therefore, the validation of various learning tools, such as modules, should also be included in the process, as this ensures the quality of the educational material that is being provided.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This qualitative-descriptive research focusing on transnational families was conducted in Guinzadan, Bauko, Mountain Province. Anchored on the Functionalist sociological theory and concepts on Conflict Theories, this study aims to describe the practices of the selected the transnational families to establish what led to the new care regime in the structure of transnational family. Thus, this study looked into the conditions caused the moving out of the parent/s; the existing situations of transnational families; and the support system of these transnational families. Having identified the issues of transnational families, the researcher proposed a program to address the issues in the transnational families in this study. The findings show that the rise of transnational families in which the husbands or wives need to work in other countries modifies the structure of the family. Households become fatherless or motherless while the grandparents, aunties, and uncles become the guardian or the head of the households. The condition of the households being left motherless or fatherless affirms the pervasiveness of transnational families, which in turn resulted in the new care roles, new parenting styles, and new support systems in the family structure. It is however interesting to note the patriarchal ideology as one of the enduring issues that run throughout the narratives of the informant; the kinship system as a push and pull factor of transnational families that strengthen their motivation to work abroad; and the functionalist theory that was manifested in the case of support system of these transnational families in maintaining the stability of the family as a primary institution. Consequently, an enrichment program for the community is needed to address the issues of transnational families, especially on the welfare of the children and the entire family.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Most studies in the field of positive psychology focused on psychological factors and their impact on mental health based on Western models and quantitative approaches (Datu, Bernardo & King, 2018). Thus, there is a need to further develop the knowledge and application of positive psychology concepts and theoretical models grounded in the lived experiences of the Filipino population. The present study utilized a qualitative research design, particularly a grounded theory method, to build a Filipino-based well-being model among university students. Findings of this research led to the formation of the BLOOMS Model of Well-being, which suggests that holistic well-being is composed of five interconnect- ed aspects (Academic, Psycho-emotional, Physical, Social, and Spiritual). Personal factors, social influences and unexpected life events were found to influence well-being. Strategies to enhance well-being were categorized into the following: Building (e.g., sleep), Leveraging (e.g., social connection), Owning (e.g., solitude), Opening (e.g. emotional expression), Molding (e.g., task management), and Self-enhancing (e.g. selfcare), leading to holistic growth. Data from this study will be used as basis for the development of a positive intervention program for university students with depressive symptoms.

       "  'abstract': \"In the course of life, educators try to update and get a grasp of the clientele they are engaged in. With the rapid influx of information through social media, it has been their preoccupation to fill in the gaps, without even realizing the reason why am I enjoying doing this. Discernment that includes - where they are, who is with them, where they have been, what am I doing, what are we doing and where they are heading. Perhaps, questioning - what is the purpose of my existence? Precepts that social media cannot answer. In the process of the study, the query, in turn, is how will the cultural identity be preserved in the influx of foreign influences brought about by an influx of information in the Philippine society? This could help and contribute to the development of the school curriculum as to the goals of the subject and the subject area. Eventually, this could help in the planning and development of the school. The layout could assess the existing programs relevant to the study. Furthermore, administrators could cascade this to the teachers in the different departments of specialization. Further, the following determinants were specifically assessed among the subjects' responses in a form of a quick survey. This includes the characteristics of our students based on their knowledge and affinity to the culture they were raised. Since the impact of the rapid turnout of the Digital Age was hypothesized, the factors that influenced the Filipino character were analyzed. The study was conducted at Cavite State University-CCAT Rosario Campus in Cavite, one of the satellites of the Cavite State University main campus. The respondents come from a Technology and Vocational course in their third year in college. The total number of respondents is fifteen (15). Based on the results, the young people of this generation are generally not too familiar with their roots, perhaps on the first level of awareness of their roots only. Custom, opinions, and position in the society also matter in posing generalizations among each other. Somehow, the environment is a factor that affects cultural identity and it is relative. Customs foster social harmony and unity within a group. It allows the opportunity to get influenced by their affinity. Furthermore, it provides important social and economic benefits. Improved learning and health increased tolerance, and opportunities to come together with others' cultures enhance our quality of life and increase overall well-being for both individuals and communities.\",\n",

The purpose of the study is to determine how and why communities in Ifugao continue to invest in social capital in their cultural practices. Ethnography, as a qualitative design, is the inquiry used in this study as it focused on explaining investing social capital along the three categories of bonding, bridging, and linking on selected Ifugao cultural events such as birthdays, engagements, marriages, and deaths. Participant observation along with interviews and coupled with focus group discussion are the tools used in collecting data. The data gathered were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings revealed that majority of the performers and participants are above 55 years old, male, married, college graduates, government employees, and have a monthly salary of over 40,000 Php. Most of the attendees to Ifugao birthdays, engagements, weddings, and death wakes perceived that non-monetary benefits were achieved such as strengthening bonds between families and close friends, bridging links with faraway friends, and connecting relationships with other participants. In terms of investment, wedding has a high cost, high return, and high return monetary value, while death has a low cost and high return monetary value.

       "  'abstract': 'The Philippine has approximately fourteen to seventeen million indigenous peoples ac- cording to the United Nations. Of all the ethno-linguistic groups in the country, the Sama Bad- jao are the most vulnerable, discriminated, exploited, and widely dispersed Muslim ethnic mi- nority in the Philippines. Conflict and poverty were the root cause of their dislocation and has led those once known as \"sea gypsies\" to other parts of the country seeking a better life. They were known as mendicants and were called by many derogatory names. Some of them found hope in Nueva Ecija and became beneficiaries of the housing program of the local govern- ment of Cabanatuan. Living in the resettlement site, the Sama Badjao led a peaceful life and free to practice their culture beliefs and customs. The purpose of the study is to explore the unique cultural beliefs and practices of the Sama Badjao regarding reproduction who are in the relocation site and describe how their status of living in the resettlement site is affecting or re-defining their concept of pregnancy and views on reproduction. This study presented the emic and etic views of the Sama Badjaos in the relocation site of Cabanatuan City regarding pregnancy, childbirth, and child care. The study utilized focused ethnography to achieve the purpose of this research. Eighteen (18) Sama Badjao were chosen as informants of the study using purposive sampling and snowball sampling. Short term immersion, participant observa- tion, formal and informal interviews, and examination of relevant documents were the instru- ments for data collection. The participants were composed of four (4) key informants and four- teen (14) informants. The findings revealed that almost all of the informant adhered some or most of beliefs and practice which were handed to them by their elders, specifically their mother. The pattern of teen pregnancies, early marriages, and home deliveries by the panday were still observed by the informants. On the other hand, the Badjao concept of menarche, the umboh (consulting departed relatives, and dowry system continue to have a prominent place in their society. The meeting of parents, the male circumcision, and the marriage ceremony are still celebrated public events of which everyone is expected to participate. Belief in the invisible entity umboh and the pag-umboh ritual are respected and observed. Insights on the richness of the concept of reproduction among the Sama Badjao may lead to revisiting the present BSN program and curriculum that will not only enrich the unique beliefs and practices of the Sama Badjao who were dispersed but will also provide culturally congruent nursing care at the same time.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The study aims to describe the communication challenges experienced by the Samal Laud people in terms of trouble with accent and fluency, different attitudes toward tribe or ethnicity, conflicting norms in cultural practices, and coping mechanism employed by the Samal to counter the challenges. The study utilized the Qualitative Research design. Under this design, an ethnographic approach employing focus group discussion and in-depth interview were carried out among 10 Samal Laud participants. The results revealed that majority of the participants experienced communication challenges in terms of tone, pronunciations, and fluency in speaking other dialects. Moreover, participants believed that learning is the best way to communicate with the other ethnic groups and learning how other tribes speak makes it easier to deal with in order to avoid being criticized. Based on the findings and conclusion of the study the following are recommendation: Government unit and non-government organizations must strengthen the participation of the Samal Laud to be part of the local projects like livelihood, community, engagement, and fun fares that will allow them to socialize with other people in order to boost their confidence and eventually improve their self-esteem and communication skills. Development communicators, must allow the Samal Laud to participate in the radio or television program for them to share their cultural backgrounds, ethnicity, and dialect and develop media output that would reach out the Samal Laud as part of the Department advocacy such as leaflet materials that would bear racial equality to bridge the gap between Samal Laud with the rest of the tribes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The youth are expected to participate in nation-building and youth development programs not just in sports but also in various sectors of society as enumerated in the United Nations Agenda 2030 and the Philippine Youth Development Plan. The Philippines have the Sangguniang Kabataan as a venue for the youth to participate in governance and is guided by the Sangguniang Kabataan Reform Act of 2015. The research focused to study about the youth governance of selected barangays of Baguio City. Information from this study could help identify effective strategies for further improving youth participation without primarily relying on sports activities. The study utilized a descriptive qualitative approach, using key participant interviews, focus group discussions, and document analysis in data gathering. The data gathered shows that the Sangguniang Kabataan conducts youth profiling as a tool to identify the needs of the youth and start from there in creating projects and programs where it showed that there were many under active citizenship. The Sangguniang Kabataan employ different strategies in formulating and implementing projects and programs such as organizational partnerships, employing intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and having adaptability, resourcefulness, and commitment to serving and empowering the youth. Despite having great strategies there is still a problem in gaining youth participation due to having non -availability of other Sangguniang Kabataan leaders, inactive youth participation, challenge on budget, and lack of facilities and training. Several programs were designed by the researchers in order to address the challenges that transpired during the conduct of the study, these were: semestral general assembly, capacity building for Sangguniang Kabataan leaders and Katipunan ng Kabataan members, and the creation of a youth center.',\n",

In the first semester of School Year 2021 2022, Quezon City University offered Gender and Society (GEE1) for the first time as an elective course for freshmen students, thus, aligning its curriculum with the gender components of the Sustainable Development Goals, the Philippine Development Goals, and of the local government of Quezon City. The purpose of the study is to understand the gender perspectives of the learners through the theories of Social Learning and Transformative Learning. An open-ended questionnaire, final course project, and video recordings of synchronous classes were used to gather data from a class of first year students enrolled in GEE 1 course. The results indicate that learners used socio-psychological concepts to define gender; vary in their perceptions of men, women, and homosexuals; gender-related roles, practices, and concepts are learned from multiple sources, which are also the sources of discriminatory practices; and variations in experiences, observation skills, and language used in learning result in varying gender perspectives. Further research on gender in academic settings is recommended.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Unprecedented changes come with multitude modification in several facets of our lives. As COVID-19 continues to persist, uses of online platforms will still be the means in continuing education as mandated by the Philippine government. In response to the mandate, Wesleyan University-Philippines provided an Learning Management System (LMS) platform to be utilized by the students and faculty members.This initiative has brought a dramatic change in the educational landscape not only to both faculty and students who were on face-to-face learning modality but also students with distance learning. However, despite the positive praises induced by the LMS platform, students have faced a significant amount of hindrances that affect their experiences. This qualitative-phenomenological study explores the lived experiences of nursing students on the use of the LMS platform. A total of eight (8) participants, varying from 4-year levels, were interviewed using a semi-structured interview through a purposive sampling approach. In generating the study's main themes, data were analyzed meticulously using thematic analysis. Based on the thick narratives of the participants, there were eight (8) major themes derived: Learning Restrictions, Enhancing Experiences, Adopting Capabilities, Recurring Emotional Stress, Noticing Competencies, Impending Unfairness, Navigating Troubles, and Grasping Knowledge. The findings of this research study have recommended addressing the challenges and issues in using LMS by capacitating both students and faculty because online learning is the trend of education today.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since it has been observed that young Filipinos are increasingly less interested in the agriculture industry as they prefer to work in offices or manage their own businesses, it caused a decline in the number of farmers. The researchers aim to design feasible agricultural information by crafting pamphlets and posters or Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials with agricultural information from the farmers of Buenakapok. This is subsequently one way of promoting and informing the youth about agriculture. The study utilized descriptive quantitative-qualitative design in establishing the needed data as it also employed purposive and snowball sampling technique. This study also determined the challenges encountered by the farmers relative to the ownership of agricultural land, the sources of agricultural information, the availability of support, and common agricultural practices. Common agricultural practices were seen by Buenakapok farmers as the most important issue among all other variables. However, Buenakapok is a developing community when it comes to agricultural farming as it gradually opens its doors to new possibilities like modern farming technology, attending agriculture seminars, and embracing new techniques in organic farming. Based on the results obtained by this study, a tri-fold pamphlet was crafted with six panels of agricultural information. However, as recommended, flyers on agricultural information in English, Filipino, Visayan, and Tausug languages should also be created.',\n",

However, the rate of suicide remained obstinately high. This phenomenological study explored the different perspectives of five suicide attempt survivors and seven mental health professionals on suicide recovery and its process. Phenomenological methods were used to analyze the participants' lived experiences through reduction, description, and finding the essence. Four essential elements emerged that elucidate these perspectives, vital in understanding suicide recovery, namely: (1) contextual elements: factors that describe how the participants view suicidality and suicide recovery; (2) facilitative elements: elements that lead to and affect the youths' suicide recovery; (3) impeding elements: factors that hinder suicide recovery; and (4) procedural elements: conditions that pertain to the steps in suicide management and intervention program. By integrating the findings of this current phenomenological study with the Inflorescence Model of Suicide Recovery, a suicide recovery paradigm was conceptualized. Exploring suicide recovery and its process showed some similarities and differences in these perspectives, contributing to the gaps or cracks in the health care system described to be fragmented. The findings were used to conceptualize the Inflorescence Suicide Management Program, which is a recovery-focused suicide management program. This program hopes to contribute to establishing a structured, systemic, and collaborative health care system, thereby strengthening suicide management care and reducing the suicide rate.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'As the world continues to expand and direct itself to new condition, the concept of globalization is inevitable. With the rise of technological transformation and popular culture, the world stage becomes widespread and demanding. For a developing country, like the Philippines, the popular demand is concerned with the process of living, i.e., employment and opportunities, since it is ubiquitous, due to its extensive population. In some ways, there has been a national crisis that Filipino people have been experiencing for years. It is not uncommon to see this in a broad picture, for there are factors that ought to consider. While factors are given within the study, the economic factor is the ultimate cause of why there exists such a problem. For many years, the general population of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) has grown in an equilibrium state, implying that labor migration is not a myth, resulting in the phenomenon of Brain Drain. Brain Drain is the efflux of professionals from developing countries to industrialized countries (Lu, 2014). As shown in the data, most of the Filipino workers who migrate overseas are land-based workers and are influenced by the specialization of elementary occupations. This study will show the total output of OFW, from 2014 to 2019, including the types of work, sexuality, popular destination, place of work, and specialization. This paper will reinstate the problem of developing countries, in terms of labor employment and lack of opportunities, and the different ways to address the problem of Brain Drain, as exemplified in the recommendation of the study.',\n",

To answer the research questions, ten (10) heads/supervisor of offices were interviewed. This research study employed a qualitative research method. It sought to describe the multimedia related needs and demands of industries and agencies. The findings showed that the multimedia materials being used in the different agencies and industries were identified as printed media, online/modern media, broadcast media, and digital electronic devices. As a result, these media have given effective ways for agencies and industries to communicate with one another, allowing them to readily reach the people in terms of information transmission. On the other hand, industries/agencies' multimedia needs or abilities were related to information technology related skills; layout artist; videographer; photographer; and writer. They determined the multimedia demands or skills of the selected agencies in Zamboanga City with respect to the multimedia materials they used. This goes to show that the production of multimedia products, particularly in the visual arts, videographer, photographer, and writer skills are in high demand in industries, notably for printed media and other visual art related materials.

The majority of the participants expressed their worries about their family, their safety, and their essential needs. The challenge of being in isolation prevented them from working. The number of days that Covid-19 patients spent in isolation had felt difficulties and hard times for them. This pandemic had taken a toll on most of the working families, experiencing low income, and even risking their lives for the sake of their families. The coping mechanisms of the participants in isolation and recovery especially the parents are their limited financial resources resulting in cutting back spending on food and reducing expenses.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The study aims to determine the adaptability of Urban Farming in Quezon City Govern- ment during the Pandemic. The urban farming offers the opportunity to provide fresh, local food to urban communities. However, urban farming can only be successfully embedded in urban areas if consumers perceive urban farming positively and accept urban farm in the community. The underpinning theoretical framework of this study is Social Practice Theory. For Social Practice theorists, actors create social structures through the social practices which they sustain and reproduce while simultaneously these practices are embedded into social structures. The concept of the study was based on the primary interested variables of the study, which is the assessment of urban farming practices in Quezon City. The respond- ents were individuals from different areas of Quezon City. There were 131 respondents who participated in the study. The researcher used a systematic random sampling to individuals from different urban farm residences in Quezon City. The study it concluded that despite of the educational attainment of the respondents, urban farming received a positive outlook from the community during the Pandemic. Urban farming will only be successful if it is accepted and perceived positively by those living in close proximity. Urban farming is more than just to bond with neighbors and preserve green spaces. It also provides communities with opportu- nities to learn about nutrition and growing food. Reweaving the urban farming through the fabric of today's society is being recommended. Likewise, the support of the government to urban food production is generally important.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study was conducted to determine The Business Competency on Employment Performance among Entrepreneurship Graduates in selected Colleges and Universities of Quezon City Basis to Personal Skills Enhancement Guide. The respondents of the study are the alumni of Selected Colleges and Universities of Quezon City from 2017-2018. There were 350 participants of this study two hundred respondents (200) in Quezon City University, one hundred (100) respondents in Bestlink Colleges of The Philippines and fifty (50) respondents in New Era University. The questionnaire was used in data collection using Frequency and Percentage; Mean and Pearson’s Moment Correlation Coefficient. The statements of questionnaire were measured using five point Likert scale. Findings revealed there is a significant correlation on business competency and employment performance satisfaction in the area of adaptability and knowledge, adaptability and disciplinary skills as well as the rewards and recognition, employee well being and opportunity enhancement. The data revealed with a P value of 0.001 which is < the level of significance 0.05. This means that as knowledge of the graduates increases, their adaptability to the business environment also increases at a rate of about 29%. Likewise, when graduates adaptability to business environment increases, their disciplinary skills also increases Although these skills are a part of the collection of qualities that combine to make an individual employable, but this does not mean that these skills are as fixed as one’s physical attributes like height,weight,size or as difficult to change as the shape of one’s facial features like hair, birthmarks, eyes & nose. Employability skills can be acquired, developed and enhanced. There is clearly no set strategies, technique nor trick to inculcate these skills in an individual but an overall cooperative learning approach by the employers, academic institutions as well as the students together will work to have the competitive advantage in the job market. Therefore, the study aimed to determine work related skills, competencies ,employment satisfaction and the level of performance that affect the graduates employability, promotion by which work values and skills provided by the Academic Institutions contribute to the graduates employability.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The mango fruit (Mangifera indica) is one of the most abundant fruits in our country. Because of the growing demand for green chemistry in science and industry, the development of green corrosion inhibitors and green inhibition techniques has recently become extremely important. The use of plant extracts as metallic corrosion inhibitors has received a lot of interest in the last several decades. The research should also learn about corrosion control compounds and components, anti-corrosive performance, and the benefits and drawbacks of MIL extract. The Mangifera Indica Leaves extract includes functional groups that can neutralize oxygen during its interaction with other molecules  according to FTIR testing (Fournier-Transfer Infrared Spectroscopy). The salt spray testing result is \"No observable defects,\" indicating that the coating effectively protected the aluminum alloy against HCL damage during immersion. The Weight-Loss Method was used on the non-coated and coated samples with varying concentrations, and the results demonstrate that the sample with no coating lost a lot of weight owing to the HCL attack. The noticeable difference is that the sample with 10% concentration, Sample B, outperformed the others. One of the most important findings from the tests is that the sample with no coating deteriorates about three times quicker than the sample with coating. This study suggests using a better binder solution, experimenting with different quantities of mango leaves extract and binder solution combinations, and conducting more testing methods for more detailed results.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In PhilSCA-VAB, thesis outputs are produced by graduating students every year. A lot of these are stored in either the school library or an online storage service. While storing them for preservation is normal and expected, it is in their retrieval and access that a problem starts to form: it is difficult to find relevant thesis outputs related to Aircraft Maintenance Technology. Most students would resort to scouring the Internet for thesis outputs that can be used as reference materials, but they are almost always met with difficulties in the form of paywalls, incompleteness and invalidity, and the lack of ease of access. The Thesis Repository System proposed by the researchers is designed to alleviate all those problems and make a step forward in the storage and accessing of AMT thesis outputs. To ascertain the Thesis Repository System’s capabilities in those two areas, a face-to-face structured interview was conducted with a combination of students, AMT research instructors, and an AMT research coordinator as the respondents. Upon using the Thesis Repository System, the respondents were exceedingly satisfied with its capabilities. By drawing results and conclusions from their transcripted and tabulated responses, it was interpreted that the Thesis Repository System is a valid, feasible, and highly effective instrument for accessing and storing relevant thesis outputs related to Aircraft Maintenance Technology. Minor improvements to the system’s design, along with proper funding, are among the recommendations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Local Universities and Colleges (LUCs) being a dynamic organizations need educational leaders who can effectively implement necessary changes for institutional development. Due to demands for reform and accountability, LUCs must meet strict educational standards or face serious consequences. Schools must find leaders that are not just willing, but able to face these challenges by successfully initiating change both for the improvement of the system as well as its ultimate reform. Commission on Higher Education (CHED) promotes Institutional Sustainability Assessment (ISA) because it can serve as a learning process for the HEIs and contribute to its continuing quality cycle for its institutional development. In response to the lack of informed research concerning educational leadership styles correlating to institutional sustainability assessment and outcomes in LUCs, the researcher is motivated to pursue this study and aims to contribute to this pressing issue of LUCs for quality mechanisms, despite of its high political influences and bureaucratic system that affect or hinder the LUCs development. Hence, the purpose of the study is to determine the situational leadership style of the individuals most responsible for changing or maintaining a system and what factors might affect the ability of a person to make meaningful changes in a school setting and the relationship of these leadership styles to ISA Key Results Areas. Descriptive method was used in the study using the Leadership Style Instrument adopted from Hershey and Blanchard and the Self-Evaluation Document of the CHED ISA administered to the LUCs Administrative and Academic Heads, using random sampling technique. The study revealed that coaching, delegating, and directing are the leadership styles exhibited by the school administrators to a moderate extent in a situation. This implies that development level of the subordinates is still in low level. The sampled LUCs “very often practiced” the Institutional sustainability indicators, as a whole. And, it is only the directing leadership style that has a significant positive relationship with governance (r=.224, p<.05); quality of teaching and learning (r=.255, p<.05); and exposure, research and creative work (r=.240, p<.05). This implies that the increase in the use of directing leadership style will also increase the practice of institutional sustainability such as governance; quality of teaching and learning; and exposure, research and creative work.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The fish drying chamber that uses salinity and moisture content and is controlled by an Atmega328P\\r\\nis a technological breakthrough that represents a significant advancement in fish drying processes. The\\r\\nuse of this chamber has the potential to revolutionize the traditional fish drying process, which is\\r\\nfrequently inefficient and inconsistent. The goal of this technology is to ensure that fish is dried evenly\\r\\nand that the required moisture content and salinity levels are met in order to produce high-quality dried\\r\\nfish. A thermostat sensor monitors the chamber's temperature, and a load cell sensor measures the\\r\\nweight of the fish before and after drying. The system can indirectly measure the moisture content of the\\r\\nfish by measuring the weight of the fish before and after drying.\\r\\nA salinometer is also used to regulate the salinity of the fish, ensuring consistent variations in salinity.\\r\\nConsistent salinity levels must be maintained during the drying process to ensure that the fish is evenly\\r\\ndried and retains its quality. The drying process within the chamber is meticulously monitored to ensure\\r\\nthat the fish is evenly dried and that the desired moisture content and salinity levels are met. Fish\\r\\nfarmers and processors can use this technology to produce high-quality, evenly dried fish that meets\\r\\nmarket standards. The fish drying chamber utilizing salinity and moisture content using Atmega328P is\\r\\na significant technological advancement that can improve the efficiency and consistency of fish drying\\r\\nprocesses.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Urban farming has become increasingly popular due to its sustainable and efficient approach to\\r\\nproducing fresh and nutritious food, particularly in densely populated areas. One promising method of\\r\\nindoor farming is through hydroponics and artificial lighting, which allows for year-round crop\\r\\nproduction in a climate-controlled environment. The SMYDRIGHT system is an innovative, automated\\r\\nvertical hydroponic system that integrates grow light technology and IoT technology. It features multiple\\r\\nsensors for real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and water quality, automatic pH level\\r\\nadjustment, and feedback mechanisms for environment, nutrient solution and water. Additionally, the\\r\\n\\r\\nsystem is designed to include an IoT platform that enables remote control and monitoring with a user-\\r\\nfriendly interface. The SMYDRIGHT project aims to provide an automated indoor hydroponic system to\\r\\n\\r\\nthe community in Riverdale St. Brgy. Sta. Monica, Novaliches, Quezon City, in partnership with the\\r\\nPublic Employment Service Office (PESO QC). The project seeks to provide a sustainable and efficient\\r\\nsystem for growing fresh produce in areas where resources are limited, and knowledge of hydroponic\\r\\nsystems is scarce. Through training and education, the community will be equipped with the skills and\\r\\nknowledge to maintain and benefit from the hydroponic system's capabilities. Ultimately, the project\\r\\naims to achieve the IoT automation of the water quality monitoring system and a working hydroponic\\r\\nsystem that can remotely monitor and control the system's critical parameters, ensuring optimal plant\\r\\ngrowth conditions.\",\n",

The\\r\\ncoffee grounds heighten the coffee like aroma and improve the scented candle's aroma. The company\\r\\nalso offers design customizations to allow consumers to express their artistic preferences and have a\\r\\nunique product.\\r\\nIn this study, we conducted an online survey questionnaire using Google forms and distributed\\r\\namong the residents of District V, Quezon City to find out if the business would be feasible. As a result,\\r\\namong the four hundred four (404) responses, three hundred eighteen (318) or 78.7% answered Yes,\\r\\nseventy-nine (79) or 19.6% answered Maybe, and only seven (7) or 1.7% said No.\\r\\nBased on the results and findings, Luwad ng Hiraya by KALIMA Company is feasible. This would start an\\r\\nupbringing of products using coffee ground wastes which would lessen the number of wastes in landfills.\\r\\nThis can create a hit in the market by encouraging people on how to upcycle that might create an\\r\\nopportunity in the other field of businesses nationwide, however, further studies are required.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"This study addresses the development of a mini fridge powered by a microcontroller that can\\r\\nmonitor the quality and freshness of leafy greens. The system includes a GSM module for remote\\r\\nmonitoring, a sprayer for humidity management, and a Peltier module for cooling. The goal of this\\r\\nproject is to solve the problem of food deterioration brought on by inadequate storage conditions, which\\r\\ncan result in risks to one's health and economic losses.\\r\\nThe project's goals are to develop and put into use a leafy greens storage system that can maintain\\r\\nideal levels of humidity and temperature while also offering real-time monitoring and alert notifications.\\r\\nA Peltier module, a solenoid lock, a sprayer, specifically a water pump, a GSM module, a DHT22, and a\\r\\nmicrocontroller unit that has been set up to sense temperature and humidity sensors are all used in the\\r\\nmethod. For SMS alarm messages and remote monitoring, the GSM module is used. Device is locked\\r\\nwith a solenoid for seven days. Pumping system for water for spraying. The project's findings\\r\\ndemonstrate that the system can maintain the ideal storage conditions for leafy greens, with\\r\\ntemperatures between 17°C and 23°C and humidity levels between 95% and 100%. In the event that\\r\\nleafy greens have already finished 7 days after, the solenoid lock will open and send real-time alerts to\\r\\nthe user's mobile phone. The microcontroller-based mini fridge for leafy greens monitoring system with\\r\\nPeltier and a sprayer with GSM module is an effective and reasonably priced way to maintain ideal\\r\\nstorage conditions. The accuracy test revealed that although the system's cooling system may be\\r\\nenhanced, it is still safe to use with an accuracy of 98.5%. On the other hand, the humidity is really good,\\r\\nand with the aid of the interior sprayer, the humidity is not a major issue. The surveillance system is also\\r\\nprecise. In conclusion, Sharon Farm can use the system.\",\n",

The study found that the sensor and Blynk interface output\\r\\nhad a high accuracy rate of 99.42%. Additionally, the average soil temperature in five trials was 43.42°C,\\r\\nindicating a high temperature classification. The average output of the Soil Moisture Parameter was\\r\\n89.4%, indicating excellent soil moisture. The soil analysis revealed that the levels of Nitrogen were\\r\\nmedium, Phosphorus were low, and Potassium were sufficient.

The Arduino nano,\\r\\nultrasonic sensor, PIR sensor, HC05, AMG8833, camera, 18650 batteries, and Li-Po Battery are the\\r\\nprimary components of the system, achieving the prototype's primary aim.

Urban farming as a potential solution to\\r\\nincrease food security and mitigate the impact of climate change on global supply chains. The declining\\r\\navailability of freshwater resources is a growing threat to humans, and new sustainable technologies\\r\\nsuch as atmospheric water generation techniques may provide a solution to this problem. The WatAir:\\r\\nWater system from air through dehumidification is an automated prototype that features a water\\r\\ngenerator that can produce water from air that may be used to water many types of plants. The system\\r\\nwill draw ambient air in, which will then be dehumidified and turned into water. The sprinkler\\r\\nautomation is handled by the module, which will be configured to water the plants once a day. If the\\r\\nmain tank is recognized to be full, the water level module will act as feedback to cease the generation of\\r\\nwater. The results done on the system demonstrate that the system is effective in terms of collecting\\r\\nwater from the air. The system's overall accuracy rating is 91.68%, indicating a high level of\\r\\ndependability in data collection and operation. The hardware and software used in the creation and\\r\\ntesting of the system are appropriate, workable, and functional. Additionally, the system's ability to use\\r\\natmospheric water effectively is demonstrated by the successful growth of okra plants, which increased\\r\\nin height, produced more leaves, and developed into fruits.\",\n",

But most people do not like\\nfoods with a bitter taste, and there is a good reason for all thesepreferences. The bitter flavor alerts us\\nbecause it may be toxic or harmful to us. Vegetables, although very healthy, do have a bitter component\\nto them. This could be from the low level of toxins created by the plant to avoid being eaten or a kind of\\nbitterness camouflage to make an animal think the plant is toxic.\\nToday, there are so many food products that offer health benefits to our body, but some picky eaters\\ndislike the bitter taste of vegetables, so we, the researchers, decided to make a product that contains a\\nbitter gourd as the main ingredient. We manage to remove the bitter taste by using salt. The best method\\nto overcome the bitterness of vegetables is brining, which is a process that puts salt in distilled water.\\nDoing that allows the salt and the water to pass through inside the veggies, which eventually eliminates\\nthe bitterness without releasing the vitamin content of the veggies. Our company promotes bitter gourd\\nas the main ingredient of our cheese spread; it contains a lot of vitamins that are good for our health.\\nOther than that, we use bitter gourd as an extender, which allows us to lower the cost of the product and\\nsell it at an affordable price.',\n",
