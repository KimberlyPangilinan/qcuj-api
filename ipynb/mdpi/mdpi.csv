Applications of 3D Reconstruction in Virtual Reality-Based Teleoperation: A Review in the Mining Industry,"Although multiview platforms have enhanced work efficiency in mining teleoperation systems, they also induce “cognitive tunneling” and depth-detection issues for operators. These issues inadvertently focus their attention on a restricted central view. Fully immersive virtual reality (VR) has recently attracted the attention of specialists in the mining industry to address these issues. Nevertheless, developing VR teleoperation systems remains a formidable challenge, particularly in achieving a realistic 3D model of the environment. This study investigates the existing gap in fully immersive teleoperation systems within the mining industry, aiming to identify the most optimal methods for their development and ensure operator’s safety. To achieve this purpose, a literature search is employed to identify and extract information from the most relevant sources. The most advanced teleoperation systems are examined by focusing on their visualization types. Then, various 3D reconstruction techniques applicable to mining VR teleoperation are investigated, and their data acquisition methods, sensor technologies, and algorithms are analyzed. Ultimately, the study discusses challenges associated with 3D reconstruction techniques for mining teleoperation. The findings demonstrated that the real-time 3D reconstruction of underground mining environments primarily involves depth-based techniques. In contrast, point cloud generation techniques can mostly be employed for 3D reconstruction in open-pit mining operations.

Reinforcement-Learning-Based Virtual Inertia Controller for Frequency Support in Islanded Microgrids,"As the world grapples with the energy crisis, integrating renewable energy sources into the power grid has become increasingly crucial. Microgrids have emerged as a vital solution to this challenge. However, the reliance on renewable energy sources in microgrids often leads to low inertia. Renewable energy sources interfaced with the network through interlinking converters lack the inertia of conventional synchronous generators, and hence, need to provide frequency support through virtual inertia techniques. This paper presents a new control algorithm that utilizes the reinforcement learning agents Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to support the frequency in low-inertia microgrids. The RL agents are trained using the system-linearized model and then extended to the nonlinear model to reduce the computational burden. The proposed system consists of an AC–DC microgrid comprising a renewable energy source on the DC microgrid, along with constant and resistive loads. On the AC microgrid side, a synchronous generator is utilized to represent the low inertia of the grid, which is accompanied by dynamic and static loads. The model of the system is developed and verified using Matlab/Simulink and the reinforcement learning toolbox. The system performance with the proposed AI-based methods is compared to conventional low-pass and high-pass filter (LPF and HPF) controllers.

Energy Sustainability Indicators for the Use of Biomass as Fuel for the Sugar Industry,"There are numerous analytical and/or computational tools for evaluating the energetic sustainability of biomass in the sugar industry. However, the simultaneous integration of the energetic–exergetic and emergetic criteria for such evaluation is still insufficient. The objective of the present work is to propose a range of indicators to evaluate the sustainability of the use of biomass as fuel in the sugar industry. For this purpose, energy, exergy, and emergy evaluation tools were theoretically used as sustainability indicators. They were validated in five variants of different biomass and their mixtures in two studies of technologies used in Cuba for the sugar industry. As a result, the energy method showed, for all variants, an increase in efficiency of about 5% in the VU-40 technology compared to the Retal technology. There is an increase in energy efficiency when considering AHRs of 2.8% or Marabu (Dichrostachys cinerea) (5.3%) compared to the V1V1<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline""><semantics><msub><mi>V</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></semantics></math> variant. Through the study of the exergetic efficiency, an increase of 2% was determined in both technologies for the case of the V1V1<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline""><semantics><msub><mi>V</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></semantics></math> variant, and an increase in efficiency is observed in the V2V2<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline""><semantics><msub><mi>V</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></semantics></math> variant of 5% and the V3V3<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline""><semantics><msub><mi>V</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></semantics></math> variant (5.6%) over the V1V1<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline""><semantics><msub><mi>V</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></semantics></math> variant. The emergetic method showed superior results for the VU-40 technology over the Retal technology due to higher fuel utilization. In the case of the V1V1<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline""><semantics><msub><mi>V</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></semantics></math> variant, there was a 7% increase in the renewability ratio and an 11.07% increase in the sustainability index. This is because more energy is produced per unit of environmental load.

A 28 GHz Highly Linear Up-Conversion Mixer for 5G Cellular Communications,"In this paper, we present a highly linear direct in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) up-conversion mixer for 5G millimeter-wave applications. To enhance the linearity of the mixer, we propose a complementary derivative superposition technique with pre-distortion. The proposed up-conversion mixer consists of a quadrature generator, LO buffer amplifiers, and an I/Q up-conversion mixer core and achieves an output third-order intercept point of 15.7 dBm and an output 1 dB compression point of 2 dBm at 27.6 GHz, while it consumes 15 mW at a supply voltage of 1 V. The conversion gain is 11.4 dB and the LO leakage and image rejection ratio are −56 dBc and 61 dB, respectively, in the measurement.

Reinforcement Learning as an Approach to Train Multiplayer First-Person Shooter Game Agents,"Artificial Intelligence bots are extensively used in multiplayer First-Person Shooter (FPS) games. By using Machine Learning techniques, we can improve their performance and bring them to human skill levels. In this work, we focused on comparing and combining two Reinforcement Learning training architectures, Curriculum Learning and Behaviour Cloning, applied to an FPS developed in the Unity Engine. We have created four teams of three agents each: one team for Curriculum Learning, one for Behaviour Cloning, and another two for two different methods of combining Curriculum Learning and Behaviour Cloning. After completing the training, each agent was matched to battle against another agent of a different team until each pairing had five wins or ten time-outs. In the end, results showed that the agents trained with Curriculum Learning achieved better performance than the ones trained with Behaviour Cloning by a matter of 23.67% more average victories in one case. In terms of the combination attempts, not only did the agents trained with both devised methods had problems during training, but they also achieved insufficient results in the battle, with an average of 0 wins.

A Comparison between Kinematic Models for Robotic Needle Insertion with Application into Transperineal Prostate Biopsy,"Transperineal prostate biopsy is the most reliable technique for detecting prostate cancer, and robot-assisted needle insertion has the potential to improve the accuracy of this procedure. Modeling the interaction between a bevel-tip needle and the tissue, considering tissue heterogeneity, needle bending, and tissue/organ deformation and movement is a required step to enable robotic needle insertion. Even if several models exist, they have never been compared on experimental grounds. Based on this motivation, this paper proposes an experimental comparison for kinematic models of needle insertion, considering different needle insertion speeds and different degrees of tissue stiffness. The experimental comparison considers automated insertions of needles into transparent silicone phantoms under stereo-image guidance. The comparison evaluates the accuracy of existing models in predicting needle deformation.

Measurement of Light-Duty Vehicle Exhaust Emissions with Light Absorption Spectrometers,"Light-duty vehicle emission regulations worldwide set limits for the following gaseous pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxides (NOX), hydrocarbons (HCs), and/or non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs). Carbon dioxide (CO2) is indirectly limited by fleet CO2 or fuel consumption targets. Measurements are carried out at the dilution tunnel with “standard” laboratory-grade instruments following well-defined principles of operation: non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) analyzers for CO and CO2, flame ionization detectors (FIDs) for hydrocarbons, and chemiluminescence analyzers (CLAs) or non-dispersive ultraviolet detectors (NDUVs) for NOX. In the United States in 2012 and in China in 2020, with Stage 6, nitrous oxide (N2O) was also included. Brazil is phasing in NH3 in its regulation. Alternative instruments that can measure some or all these pollutants include Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)- and laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS)-based instruments. In the second category, quantum cascade laser (QCL) spectroscopy in the mid-infrared area or laser diode spectroscopy (LDS) in the near-infrared area, such as tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS), are included. According to current regulations and technical specifications, NH3 is the only component that has to be measured at the tailpipe to avoid ammonia losses due to its hydrophilic properties and adsorption on the transfer lines. There are not many studies that have evaluated such instruments, in particular those for “non-regulated” worldwide pollutants. For this reason, we compared laboratory-grade “standard” analyzers with FTIR- and TDLAS-based instruments measuring NH3. One diesel and two gasoline vehicles at different ambient temperatures and with different test cycles produced emissions in a wide range. In general, the agreement among the instruments was very good (in most cases, within ±10%), confirming their suitability for the measurement of pollutants.

Visualization of Spatial–Temporal Epidemiological Data: A Scoping Review,"In recent years, the proliferation of health data sources due to computer technologies has prompted the use of visualization techniques to tackle epidemiological challenges. However, existing reviews lack a specific focus on the spatial and temporal analysis of epidemiological data using visualization tools. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a scoping review following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, examining the literature from 2000 to 2024 on spatial–temporal visualization techniques when applied to epidemics, across five databases: PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ACM Digital Library until 24 January 2024. Among 1312 papers reviewed, 114 were selected, emphasizing aggregate measures, web platform tools, and geospatial data representation, particularly favoring choropleth maps and extended charts. Visualization techniques were predominantly utilized for real-time data presentation, trend analysis, and predictions. Evaluation methods, categorized into standard methodology, user experience, task efficiency, and accuracy, were observed. Although various open-access datasets were available, only a few were commonly used, mainly those related to COVID-19. This study sheds light on the current trends in visualizing epidemiological data over the past 24 years, highlighting the gaps in standardized evaluation methodologies and the limited exploration of individual epidemiological data and diseases acquired in hospitals during epidemics.

Mapping Acoustic Frictional Properties of Self-Lubricating Epoxy-Coated Bearing Steel with Acoustic Emissions during Friction Test,"This work investigates the stick–slip phenomenon during sliding motion between solid lubricant-impregnated epoxy polymer-coated steel bars and AISI 52,100 steel balls. An acoustic sensor detected the stick–slip phenomenon during the tribo-pair interaction. The wear characteristics of the workpiece coated with different epoxy coatings were observed and scrutinized. The RMS values of the acoustic sensor were correlated with the frictional coefficient to develop a standard based on the acoustic sensor, leading to the detection of the stick–slip phenomenon. As per the findings, the acoustic waveform remained relatively similar to the friction coefficient observed during the study and can be used effectively in detecting the stick–slip phenomenon between steel and polymer interaction. This work will be highly beneficial in industrial and automotive applications with a significant interaction of polymer and steel surfaces.

A Kinetic Study of a Photo-Oxidation Reaction between α-Terpinene and Singlet Oxygen in a Novel Oscillatory Baffled Photo Reactor,"By planting LEDs on the surfaces of orifice baffles, a novel batch oscillatory baffled photoreactor (OBPR) together with polymer-supported Rose Bengal (Ps-RB) beads are here used to investigate the reaction kinetics of a photo-oxidation reaction between α-terpinene and singlet oxygen (1O2). In the mode of NMR data analysis that is widely used for this reaction, α-terpinene and ascaridole are treated as a reaction pair, assuming kinetically singlet oxygen is in excess or constant. We have, for the first time, here examined the validity of the method, discovered that increasing α-terpinene initially leads to an increase in ascaridole, indicating that the supply of singlet oxygen is in excess. Applying a kinetic analysis, a pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics is confirmed, supporting this assumption. We have subsequently initiated a methodology of estimating the 1O2 concentrations based on the proportionality of ascaridole concentrations with respect to its maximum under these conditions. With the help of the estimated singlet oxygen data, the efficiency of 1O2 utilization and the photo efficiency of converting molecular oxygen to 1O2 are further proposed and evaluated. We have also identified conditions under which a further increase in α-terpinene has caused decreases in ascaridole, implying kinetically that 1O2 has now become a limiting reagent, and the method of treating α-terpinene and ascaridole as a reaction pair in the data analysis would no longer be valid under those conditions.

Nested Contrastive Boundary Learning: Point Transformer Self-Attention Regularization for 3D Intracranial Aneurysm Segmentation,"In 3D segmentation, point-based models excel but face difficulties in precise class delineation at class intersections, an inherent challenge in segmentation models. This is particularly critical in medical applications, influencing patient care and surgical planning, where accurate 3D boundary identification is essential for assisting surgery and enhancing medical training through advanced simulations. This study introduces the Nested Contrastive Boundary Learning Point Transformer (NCBL-PT), specially designed for 3D point cloud segmentation. NCBL-PT employs contrastive learning to improve boundary point representation by enhancing feature similarity within the same class. NCBL-PT incorporates a border-aware distinction within the same class points, allowing the model to distinctly learn from both points in proximity to the class intersection and from those beyond. This reduces semantic confusion among the points of different classes in the ambiguous class intersection zone, where similarity in features due to proximity could lead to incorrect associations. The model operates within subsampled point clouds at each encoder block stage of the point transformer architecture. It applies self-attention with k = 16 nearest neighbors to local neighborhoods, aligning with NCBL calculations for consistent self-attention regularization in local contexts. NCBL-PT improves 3D segmentation at class intersections, as evidenced by a 3.31% increase in Intersection over Union (IOU) for aneurysm segmentation compared to the base point transformer model.

By emphasizing energy efficiency, process time, and coating thickness on complex surfaces, a hybrid optimization technique enhances overall efficiency. Extensive hardware and software development results in a robust robotic system leveraging the Robot Operating System (ROS). Integrating a low-cost 3D scanner, calibrator, and trajectory optimizer creates an autonomous painting system. Hardware components, including sensors, motors, and actuators, are seamlessly integrated with a Python and ROS-based software framework, enabling the desired automation. A web-based GUI, powered by JavaScript, allows user control over two robots, facilitating trajectory dispatch, 3D scanning, and optimization. Specific nodes manage calibration, validation, process settings, and real-time video feeds. The use of open-source software and an ROS ecosystem makes it a good choice for industrial-scale implementation. The results indicate that the proposed system can achieve the desired automation, contingent upon surface geometries, spraying processes, and robot dynamics.

A National Innovation System Concept-Based Analysis of Autonomous Vehicles’ Potential in Reaching Zero-Emission Fleets,"Change management for technology adoption in the transportation sector is often used to address long-term challenges characterized by complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity. Especially when technology is still evolving, an analysis of these challenges can help explore different alternative future pathways. Therefore, the analysis of development trajectories, correlations between key system variables, and the rate of change within the entire road transportation system can guide action toward sustainability. By adopting the National Innovation System concept, we evaluated the possibilities of an autonomous vehicle option to reach a zero-emission fleet.

Exploiting PlanetScope Imagery for Volcanic Deposits Mapping,"During explosive eruptions, tephra fallout represents one of the main volcanic hazards and can be extremely dangerous for air traffic, infrastructures, and human health. Here, we present a new technique aimed at identifying the area covered by tephra after an explosive event, based on processing PlanetScope imagery. We estimate the mean reflectance values of the visible (RGB) and near infrared (NIR) bands, analyzing pre- and post-eruptive data in specific areas and introducing a new index, which we call the ‘Tephra Fallout Index (TFI)’. We use the Google Earth Engine computing platform and define a threshold for the TFI of different eruptive events to distinguish the areas affected by the tephra fallout and quantify the surface coverage density. We apply our technique to the eruptive events occurring in 2021 at Mt. Etna (Italy), which mainly involved the eastern flank of the volcano, sometimes two or three times within a day, making field surveys difficult. Whenever possible, we compare our results with field data and find an optimal match. This work could have important implications for the identification and quantification of short-term volcanic hazard assessments in near real-time during a volcanic eruption, but also for the mapping of other hazardous events worldwide.

High Affinity of Nanoparticles and Matrices Based on Acid-Base Interaction for Nanoparticle-Filled Membrane,"The introduction of nanoparticles into the polymer matrix is a useful technique for creating highly functional composite membranes. Our research focuses on the development of nanoparticle-filled proton exchange membranes (PEMs). PEMs play a crucial role in efficiently controlling the electrical energy conversion process by facilitating the movement of specific ions. This is achieved by creating functionalized nanoparticles with polymer coatings on their surfaces, which are then combined with resins to create proton-conducting membranes. In this study, we prepared PEMs by coating the surfaces of silica nanoparticles with acidic polymers and integrating them into a basic matrix. This process resulted in the formation of a direct bond between the nanoparticles and the matrix, leading to composite membranes with a high dispersion and densely packed nanoparticles. This fabrication technique significantly improved mechanical strength and retention stability, resulting in high-performance membranes. Moreover, the proton conductivity of these membranes showed a remarkable enhancement of more than two orders of magnitude compared to the pristine basic matrix, reaching 4.2 × 10−4 S/cm at 80 °C and 95% relative humidity.

Angle Calculus-Based Thrust Force Determination on the Blades of a 10 kW Wind Turbine,"In this article, the behavior of the thrust force on the blades of a 10 kW wind turbine was obtained by considering the characteristic wind speed of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Analyzing mechanical forces is essential to efficiently and safely design the different elements that make up the wind turbine because the thrust forces are related to the location point and the blade rotation. For this reason, the thrust force generated in each of the three blades of a low-power wind turbine was analyzed. The angular position (θ) of each blade varied from 0° to 120°, the blades were segmented (r), and different wind speeds were tested, such as cutting, design, average, and maximum. The results demonstrate that the thrust force increases proportionally with increasing wind speed and height, but it behaves differently on each blade segment and each angular position. This method determines the angular position and the exact blade segment where the smallest and the most considerable thrust force occurred. Blade 1, positioned at an angular position of 90°, is the blade most affected by the thrust force on P15. When the blade rotates 180°, the thrust force decreases by 9.09 N; this represents a 66.74% decrease. In addition, this study allows the designers to know the blade deflection caused by the thrust force. This information can be used to avoid collision with the tower. The thrust forces caused blade deflections of 10% to 13% concerning the rotor radius used in this study. These results guarantee the operation of the tested generator under their working conditions.

Parametric Metamodeling Based on Optimal Transport Applied to Uncertainty Evaluation,"When training a parametric surrogate to represent a real-world complex system in real time, there is a common assumption that the values of the parameters defining the system are known with absolute confidence. Consequently, during the training process, our focus is directed exclusively towards optimizing the accuracy of the surrogate’s output. However, real physics is characterized by increased complexity and unpredictability. Notably, a certain degree of uncertainty may exist in determining the system’s parameters. Therefore, in this paper, we account for the propagation of these uncertainties through the surrogate using a standard Monte Carlo methodology. Subsequently, we propose a novel regression technique based on optimal transport to infer the impact of the uncertainty of the surrogate’s input on its output precision in real time. The OT-based regression allows for the inference of fields emulating physical reality more accurately than classical regression techniques, including advanced ones.

An Optimum Load Forecasting Strategy (OLFS) for Smart Grids Based on Artificial Intelligence,"Recently, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in many areas of life has allowed raising the efficiency of systems and converting them into smart ones, especially in the field of energy. Integrating AI with power systems allows electrical grids to be smart enough to predict the future load, which is known as Intelligent Load Forecasting (ILF). Hence, suitable decisions for power system planning and operation procedures can be taken accordingly. Moreover, ILF can play a vital role in electrical demand response, which guarantees a reliable transitioning of power systems. This paper introduces an Optimum Load Forecasting Strategy (OLFS) for predicting future load in smart electrical grids based on AI techniques. The proposed OLFS consists of two sequential phases, which are: Data Preprocessing Phase (DPP) and Load Forecasting Phase (LFP). In the former phase, an input electrical load dataset is prepared before the actual forecasting takes place through two essential tasks, namely feature selection and outlier rejection. Feature selection is carried out using Advanced Leopard Seal Optimization (ALSO) as a new nature-inspired optimization technique, while outlier rejection is accomplished through the Interquartile Range (IQR) as a measure of statistical dispersion. On the other hand, actual load forecasting takes place in LFP using a new predictor called the Weighted K-Nearest Neighbor (WKNN) algorithm. The proposed OLFS has been tested through extensive experiments. Results have shown that OLFS outperforms recent load forecasting techniques as it introduces the maximum prediction accuracy with the minimum root mean square error.

A Comprehensive Performance Analysis of a 48-Watt Transformerless DC-DC Boost Converter Using a Proportional–Integral–Derivative Controller with Special Attention to Inductor Design and Components Reliability,"In this research paper, a comprehensive performance analysis was carried out for a 48-watt transformerless DC-DC boost converter using a Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) controller through dynamic modeling. In a boost converter, the optimal design of the magnetic element plays an important role in efficient energy transfer. This research paper emphasizes the design of an inductor using the Area Product Technique (APT) to analyze factors such as area product, window area, number of turns, and wire size. Observations were made by examining its response to changes in load current, supply voltage, and load resistance at frequency levels of 100 and 500 kHz. Moreover, this paper extended its investigation by analyzing the failure rates and reliability of active and passive components in a 48-watt boost converter, providing valuable insights about failure behavior and reliability. Frequency domain analysis was conducted to assess the controller’s stability and robustness. The results conclusively underscore the benefits of incorporating the designed PID controller in terms of achieving the desired regulation and rapid response to disturbances at 100 and 500 kHz. The findings emphasize the outstanding reliability of the inductor, evident from the significantly low failure rates in comparison to other circuit components. Conversely, the research also reveals the inherent vulnerability of the switching device (MOSFET), characterized by a higher failure rate and lower reliability. The MATLAB® Simulink platform was utilized to investigate the results.

Comprehensive Study of Compression and Texture Integration for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine Data Analysis,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its strain on healthcare resources, this study presents a comprehensive review of various techniques that can be used to integrate image compression techniques and statistical texture analysis to optimize the storage of Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files. In evaluating four predominant image compression algorithms, i.e., discrete cosine transform (DCT), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the fractal compression algorithm (FCA), and the vector quantization algorithm (VQA), this study focuses on their ability to compress data while preserving essential texture features such as contrast, correlation, angular second moment (ASM), and inverse difference moment (IDM). A pivotal observation concerns the direction-independent Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) in DICOM analysis, which reveals intriguing variations between two intermediate scans measured with texture characteristics. Performance-wise, the DCT, DWT, FCA, and VQA algorithms achieved minimum compression ratios (CRs) of 27.87, 37.91, 33.26, and 27.39, respectively, with maximum CRs at 34.48, 68.96, 60.60, and 38.74. This study also undertook a statistical analysis of distinct CT chest scans from COVID-19 patients, highlighting evolving texture patterns. Finally, this work underscores the potential of coupling image compression and texture feature quantification for monitoring changes related to human chest conditions, offering a promising avenue for efficient storage and diagnostic assessment of critical medical imaging.

Attention-Based Ensemble Network for Effective Breast Cancer Classification over Benchmarks,"Globally, breast cancer (BC) is considered a major cause of death among women. Therefore, researchers have used various machine and deep learning-based methods for its early and accurate detection using X-ray, MRI, and mammography image modalities. However, the machine learning model requires domain experts to select an optimal feature, obtains a limited accuracy, and has a high false positive rate due to handcrafting features extraction. The deep learning model overcomes these limitations, but these models require large amounts of training data and computation resources, and further improvement in the model performance is needed. To do this, we employ a novel framework called the Ensemble-based Channel and Spatial Attention Network (ECS-A-Net) to automatically classify infected regions within BC images. The proposed framework consists of two phases: in the first phase, we apply different augmentation techniques to enhance the size of the input data, while the second phase includes an ensemble technique that parallelly leverages modified SE-ResNet50 and InceptionV3 as a backbone for feature extraction, followed by Channel Attention (CA) and Spatial Attention (SA) modules in a series manner for more dominant feature selection. To further validate the ECS-A-Net, we conducted extensive experiments between several competitive state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques over two benchmarks, including DDSM and MIAS, where the proposed model achieved 96.50% accuracy for the DDSM and 95.33% accuracy for the MIAS datasets. Additionally, the experimental results demonstrated that our network achieved a better performance using various evaluation indicators, including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity among other methods.

Comparison of Shallow (−20 °C) and Deep Cryogenic Treatment (−196 °C) to Enhance the Properties of a Mg/2wt.%CeO2 Nanocomposite,"Magnesium and its composites have been used in various applications owing to their high specific strength properties and low density. However, the application is limited to room-temperature conditions owing to the lack of research available on the ability of magnesium alloys to perform in sub-zero conditions. The present study attempted, for the first time, the effects of two cryogenic temperatures (−20 °C/253 K and −196 °C/77 K) on the physical, thermal, and mechanical properties of a Mg/2wt.%CeO2 nanocomposite. The materials were synthesized using the disintegrated melt deposition method followed by hot extrusion. The results revealed that the shallow cryogenically treated (refrigerated at −20 °C) samples display a reduction in porosity, lower ignition resistance, similar microhardness, compressive yield, and ultimate strength and failure strain when compared to deep cryogenically treated samples in liquid nitrogen at −196 °C. Although deep cryogenically treated samples showed an overall edge, the extent of the increase in properties may not be justified, as samples exposed at −20 °C display very similar mechanical properties, thus reducing the overall cost of the cryogenic process. The results were compared with the data available in the open literature, and the mechanisms behind the improvement of the properties were evaluated.

Machine Learning Approaches to Predict Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Atrial Fibrillation,"The increasing prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and its association with Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) presents challenges in early identification and treatment. Although existing risk factors, biomarkers, genetic variants, and imaging parameters predict MACE, emerging factors may be more decisive. Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques (ML) offer a promising avenue for more effective AF evolution prediction. Five ML models were developed to obtain predictors of MACE in AF patients. Two-thirds of the data were used for training, employing diverse approaches and optimizing to minimize prediction errors, while the remaining third was reserved for testing and validation. AdaBoost emerged as the top-performing model (accuracy: 0.9999; recall: 1; F1 score: 0.9997). Noteworthy features influencing predictions included the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), diabetes mellitus, cancer, the Wells scale, and CHA2DS2-VASc, with specific associations identified. Elevated MACE risk was observed, with a CCI score exceeding 2.67 ± 1.31 (p < 0.001), CHA2DS2-VASc score of 4.62 ± 1.02 (p < 0.001), and an intermediate-risk Wells scale classification. Overall, the AdaBoost ML offers an alternative predictive approach to facilitate the early identification of MACE risk in the assessment of patients with AF.

Multi-Arm Trajectory Planning for Optimal Collision-Free Pick-and-Place Operations,"This article addresses the problem of automating a multi-arm pick-and-place robotic system. The objective is to optimize the execution time of a task simultaneously performed by multiple robots, sharing the same workspace, and determining the order of operations to be performed. Due to its ability to address decision-making problems of all kinds, the system is modeled under the mathematical framework of the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this particular work, the model is adjusted to a deterministic, single-agent, and fully observable system, which allows for its comparison with other resolution methods such as graph search algorithms and Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). The proposed approach provides three advantages: it plans the trajectory to perform the task in minimum time; it considers how to avoid collisions between robots; and it automatically generates the robot code for any robot manufacturer and any initial objects’ positions in the workspace. The result meets the objectives and is a fast and robust system that can be safely employed in a production line.

A Mixed Reality Design System for Interior Renovation: Inpainting with 360-Degree Live Streaming and Generative Adversarial Networks after Removal,"In contemporary society, “Indoor Generation” is becoming increasingly prevalent, and spending long periods of time indoors affects well-being. Therefore, it is essential to research biophilic indoor environments and their impact on occupants. When it comes to existing building stocks, which hold significant social, economic, and environmental value, renovation should be considered before new construction. Providing swift feedback in the early stages of renovation can help stakeholders achieve consensus. Additionally, understanding proposed plans can greatly enhance the design of indoor environments. This paper presents a real-time system for architectural designers and stakeholders that integrates mixed reality (MR), diminished reality (DR), and generative adversarial networks (GANs). The system enables the generation of interior renovation drawings based on user preferences and designer styles via GANs. The system’s seamless integration of MR, DR, and GANs provides a unique and innovative approach to interior renovation design. MR and DR technologies then transform these 2D drawings into immersive experiences that help stakeholders evaluate and understand renovation proposals. In addition, we assess the quality of GAN-generated images using full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) methods. The evaluation results indicate that most images demonstrate moderate quality. Almost all objects in the GAN-generated images can be identified by their names and purposes without any ambiguity or confusion. This demonstrates the system’s effectiveness in producing viable renovation visualizations. This research emphasizes the system’s role in enhancing feedback efficiency during renovation design, enabling stakeholders to fully evaluate and understand proposed renovations.

Extended-Window Algorithms for Model Prediction Applied to Hybrid Power Systems,"This paper proposes extended-window algorithms for model prediction and applies them to optimize hybrid power systems. We consider a hybrid power system comprising solar panels, batteries, a fuel cell, and a chemical hydrogen generation system. The proposed algorithms enable the periodic updating of prediction models and corresponding changes in system parts and power management based on the accumulated data. We first develop a hybrid power model to evaluate system responses under different conditions. We then build prediction models using five artificial intelligence algorithms. Among them, the light gradient boosting machine and extreme gradient boosting methods achieve the highest accuracies for predicting solar radiation and load responses, respectively. Therefore, we apply these two models to forecast solar and load responses. Third, we introduce extended-window algorithms and investigate the effects of window sizes and replacement costs on system performance. The results show that the optimal window size is one week, and the system cost is 13.57% lower than the cost of the system that does not use the extended-window algorithms. The proposed method also tends to make fewer component replacements when the replacement cost increases. Finally, we design experiments to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of systems using extended-window model prediction.

"Revisiting Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis: Extensions, Challenges and Insights","This manuscript provides a comprehensive exploration of Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), highlighting its strengths, drawbacks, and challenges. The PLSA, originally a tool for information retrieval, provides a probabilistic sense for a table of co-occurrences as a mixture of multinomial distributions spanned over a latent class variable and adjusted with the expectation–maximization algorithm. The distributional assumptions and the iterative nature lead to a rigid model, dividing enthusiasts and detractors. Those drawbacks have led to several reformulations: the extension of the method to normal data distributions and a non-parametric formulation obtained with the help of Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) techniques. Furthermore, the combination of theoretical studies and programming techniques alleviates the computational problem, thus making the potential of the method explicit: its relation with the Singular value decomposition (SVD), which means that PLSA can be used to satisfactorily support other techniques, such as the construction of Fisher kernels, the probabilistic interpretation of Principal component analysis (PCA), Transfer learning (TL), and the training of neural networks, among others. We also present open questions as a practical and theoretical research window.

Graph Learning and Deep Neural Network Ensemble for Supporting Cognitive Decline Assessment,"Cognitive decline represents a significant public health concern due to its severe implications on memory and general health. Early detection is crucial to initiate timely interventions and improve patient outcomes. However, traditional diagnosis methods often rely on personal interpretations or biases, may not detect the early stages of cognitive decline, or involve invasive screening procedures; thus, there is a growing interest in developing non-invasive methods benefiting also from the technological advances. Wearable devices and Internet of Things sensors can monitor various aspects of daily life together with health parameters and can provide valuable data regarding people’s behavior. In this paper, we propose a technical solution that can be useful for potentially supporting cognitive decline assessment in early stages, by employing advanced machine learning techniques for detecting higher activity fragmentation based on daily activity monitoring using wearable devices. Our approach also considers data coming from wellbeing assessment questionnaires that can offer other important insights about a monitored person. We use deep neural network models to capture complex, non-linear relationships in the daily activities data and graph learning for the structural wellbeing information in the questionnaire answers. The proposed solution is evaluated in a simulated environment on a large synthetic dataset, the results showing that our approach can offer an alternative as a support for early detection of cognitive decline during patient-assessment processes.

Transformative Approach for Heart Rate Prediction from Face Videos Using Local and Global Multi-Head Self-Attention,"Heart rate estimation from face videos is an emerging technology that offers numerous potential applications in healthcare and human–computer interaction. However, most of the existing approaches often overlook the importance of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, which is essential for robust measurement of heart rate prediction. Additionally, they involve extensive pre-processing steps to enhance the prediction accuracy, resulting in high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose an innovative solution called LGTransPPG. This end-to-end transformer-based framework eliminates the need for pre-processing steps while achieving improved efficiency and accuracy. LGTransPPG incorporates local and global aggregation techniques to capture fine-grained facial features and contextual information. By leveraging the power of transformers, our framework can effectively model long-range dependencies and temporal dynamics, enhancing the heart rate prediction process. The proposed approach is evaluated on three publicly available datasets, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability. Furthermore, we achieved a high Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) value of 0.88, indicating its superior efficiency and accuracy between the predicted and actual heart rate values.

Information-Analytical Software for Developing Digital Models of Porous Structures’ Materials Using a Cellular Automata Approach,"An information-analytical software has been developed for creating digital models of structures of porous materials. The information-analytical software allows you to select a model that accurately reproduces structures of porous materials—aerogels—creating a digital model by which you can predict their properties. In addition, the software contains models for calculating various properties of aerogels based on their structure, such as pore size distribution and mechanical properties. Models have been implemented that allow the description of various processes in porous structures—hydrodynamics of multicomponent systems, heat and mass transfer processes, dissolution, sorption and desorption. With the models implemented in this software, various digital models for different types of aerogels can be developed. As a comparison parameter, pore size distribution is chosen. Deviation of the calculated pore size distribution curves from the experimental ones does not exceed 15%, which indicates that the obtained digital model corresponds to the experimental sample. The software contains both the existing models that are used for porous structures modeling and the original models that were developed for different studied aerogels and processes, such as the dissolution of active pharmaceutical ingredients and mass transportation in porous media.

Generating Mathematical Expressions for Estimation of Atomic Coordinates of Carbon Nanotubes Using Genetic Programming Symbolic Regression,"The study addresses the formidable challenge of calculating atomic coordinates for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using density functional theory (DFT), a process that can endure for days. To tackle this issue, the research leverages the Genetic Programming Symbolic Regression (GPSR) method on a publicly available dataset. The primary aim is to assess if the resulting Mathematical Equations (MEs) from GPSR can accurately estimate calculated atomic coordinates obtained through DFT. Given the numerous hyperparameters in GPSR, a Random Hyperparameter Value Search (RHVS) method is devised to pinpoint the optimal combination of hyperparameter values, maximizing estimation accuracy. Two distinct approaches are considered. The first involves applying GPSR to estimate calculated coordinates (uc, vc, wc) using all input variables (initial atomic coordinates u, v, w, and integers n, m specifying the chiral vector). The second approach applies GPSR to estimate each calculated atomic coordinate using integers n and m alongside the corresponding initial atomic coordinates. This results in the creation of six different dataset variations. The GPSR algorithm undergoes training via a 5-fold cross-validation process. The evaluation metrics include the coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and the depth and length of generated MEs. The findings from this approach demonstrate that GPSR can effectively estimate CNT atomic coordinates with high accuracy, as indicated by an impressive R2≈1.0. This study not only contributes to the advancement of accurate estimation techniques for atomic coordinates but also introduces a systematic approach for optimizing hyperparameters in GPSR, showcasing its potential for broader applications in materials science and computational chemistry.

Comparing Classical and Quantum Generative Learning Models for High-Fidelity Image Synthesis,"The field of computer vision has long grappled with the challenging task of image synthesis, which entails the creation of novel high-fidelity images. This task is underscored by the Generative Learning Trilemma, which posits that it is not possible for any image synthesis model to simultaneously excel at high-quality sampling, achieve mode convergence with diverse sample representation, and perform rapid sampling. In this paper, we explore the potential of Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) for image synthesis, leveraging the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer. We undertake a comprehensive performance assessment of QBMs in comparison to established generative models in the field: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). Our evaluation is grounded in widely recognized scoring metrics, including the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Kernel Inception Distance (KID), and Inception Scores. The results of our study indicate that QBMs do not significantly outperform the conventional models in terms of the three evaluative criteria. Moreover, QBMs have not demonstrated the capability to overcome the challenges outlined in the Trilemma of Generative Learning. Through our investigation, we contribute to the understanding of quantum computing’s role in generative learning and identify critical areas for future research to enhance the capabilities of image synthesis models.

The Holby–Morgan Model of Platinum Catalyst Degradation in PEM Fuel Cells: Range of Feasible Parameters Achieved Using Voltage Cycling,"Loss of electrochemical surface area in proton-exchange membrane is of large practical importance, since membrane degradation largely affects the durability and life of fuel cells. In this paper, the electrokinetic model developed by Holby and Morgan is considered. The paper describes degradation mechanisms in membrane catalyst presented by platinum dissolution, platinum diffusion, and platinum oxide formation. A one-dimensional model is governed by nonlinear reaction–diffusion equations given in a cathodic catalyst layer using Butler–Volmer relationships for reaction rates. The governing system is endowed with initial conditions, mixed no-flux boundary condition at the interface with gas diffusion layer, and a perfectly absorbing condition at the membrane boundary. In cyclic voltammetry tests, a non-symmetric square waveform is applied for the electric potential difference between 0.6 and 0.9 V held for 10 and 30 s, respectively, according to the protocol of European Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking. Aimed at mitigation strategies, the impact of cycling operating conditions and model parameters on the loss rate of active area is investigated. The global behavior with respect to variation of parameters is performed using the method of sensitivity analysis. Finding feasible and unfeasible values helps to determine the range of test parameters employed in the model. Comprehensive results of numerical simulation tests are presented and discussed.

AI-Enabled Compressive Spectrum Classification for Wideband Radios,"Cognitive radio is a promising technology that emerged as a potential solution to the spectrum shortage problem by enabling opportunistic spectrum access. In many cases, cognitive radios are required to sense a wide range of frequencies to locate the spectrum white spaces; hence, wideband spectrum comes into play, which is also an essential step in future wireless systems to boost the throughput. Cognitive radios are intelligent devices and therefore can be opted for the development of modern jamming and anti-jamming solutions. To this end, our article introduces a novel AI-enabled energy-efficient and robust technique for wideband radio spectrum characterization. Our work considers a wideband radio spectrum made up of numerous narrowband signals, which could be normal communications or signals disrupted by a stealthy jammer. First, the receiver recovers the wideband from significantly low sub-Nyquist rate samples by exploiting compressive sensing technique to decrease the overhead caused by the high complexity analog-to-digital conversion process. Once the wideband is recovered, each available narrowband signal is given to a cyclostationary feature detector that computes the corresponding spectral correlation function and extracts the feature vectors in the form of cycle and frequency profiles. Then profiles are concatenated and given as input features set to an artificial neural network which in turn classifies each NB signal as legitimate communication with a specific modulation or disrupted by a stealthy jammer. The results show a classification accuracy of about 0.99 is achieved. Moreover, the algorithm highlights significantly high performances in comparison to recently reported spectrum classification techniques. The proposed technique can be used to design anti-jamming systems for military communication systems.

Enhancing Multiple Properties of a Multicomponent Mg-Based Alloy Using a Sinterless Turning-Induced Deformation Technique,"A magnesium-based multi-component alloy (MCA), Mg70Al18Zn6Ca4Y2, was successfully synthesized using the Turning-Induced Deformation (TID) method, with promising improvements in multiple properties such as damping capabilities, hardness (11% to 34% increase), and strength (5% to 15% increase) over its conventional cast and extruded equivalent which has already been established as a high-performance MCA exhibiting superior mechanical properties over other Mg-based materials while retaining acceptable ductility. This new TID-based MCA comes only at a slight compromise in the aspects of ductility, ignition resistance, and corrosion resistance, which was previously observed in other TID-based materials. In addition, the general microstructure and secondary phases of this MCA were retained even when using the TID method, with only minimal porosity (<1%) incurred during the process. Furthermore, the ignition temperature of the TID Mg70Al18Zn6Ca4Y2 remained very high at 915 °C, positioning it as a potential Mg-based material suitable for aerospace applications with a high ignition resistance. This is tantamount to a successful application of TID to yet another class of Mg-based materials and opening the door to future explorations of such materials.

Cost-Effective 3D Printing of Silicone Structures Using an Advanced Intra-Layer Curing Approach,"We present an advanced, low-cost 3D printing system capable of fabricating intricate silicone structures using commercially available off-the-shelf materials. Our system used a custom-designed, motorised syringe pump with a driving lead screw and excellent control of material extrusion to accommodate the high viscosity of silicone printing ink, which is composed of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), diluent, and a photo-initiator (LAP). We modified an open-source desktop 3D printer to mount the syringe pump and programmed it to deposit controlled intricate patterns in a layer-by-layer fashion. To ensure the structural integrity of the printed objects, we introduced an intra-layer curing approach that fused the deposited layers using a custom-built UV curing system. Our experiments demonstrated the successful fabrication of silicone structures at different infill percentages, with excellent resolution and mechanical properties. Our low-cost solution (costing less than USD 1000 and requiring no specialised facilities or equipment) shows great promise for practical applications in areas such as micro-fluidics, prosthesis, and biomedical engineering based on our initial findings of 300 μm width channels (with excellent scope for smaller channels where desirable) and tunable structural properties. Our work represents a significant advance in low-cost desktop 3D printing capabilities, and we anticipate that it could have a broad impact on the field by providing these capabilities to scholars without the means to purchase expensive fabrication systems.

Use of a Residual Neural Network to Demonstrate Feasibility of Ship Detection Based on Synthetic Aperture Radar Raw Data,"Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a well-established 2D imaging technique employed as a consolidated practice in several oil spill monitoring services. In this scenario, onboard detection undoubtedly represents an interesting solution to reduce the latency of these services, also enabling transmission to the ground segment of alert signals with a notable reduction in the required downlink bandwidth. However, the reduced computational capabilities available onboard require alternative approaches with respect to the standard processing flows. In this work, we propose a feasibility study of oil spill detection applied directly to raw data, which is a solution not sufficiently addressed in the literature that has the advantage of not requiring the execution of the focusing step. The study is concentrated only on the accuracy of detection, while computational cost analysis is not within the scope of this work. More specifically, we propose a complete framework based on the use of a Residual Neural Network (ResNet), including a simple and automatic simulation method for generating the training data set. The final tests with ERS real data demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach showing that the trained ResNet correctly detects ships with a Signal-to-Clutter Ratio (SCR) > 10.3 dB.

Analysis of the Effect of Cutting Motion Speed in CNC Laser Cutting on Roughness and Accuracy,"The cutting speed of laser cutting is predicted to affect the roughness of its object. However, its roughness characteristics still need to be determined to consider whether it is tolerant. The aspects of cutting products are studied intensely. Specific cutting styles with different plates like Eser thick versus velocity of the cut varied, affecting the fineness of surface cutting. However, a monitor showing frequency and period explained the more significant roughness. Those are predicted to be straightforward for checking samples. Using CMM and the Surface Roughness Tester, the cutting parameter and its process can be recommended for future applications.

Development of an Automated Downtime System for Small and Medium sized Enterprises,"The implementation of Industry 4.0 can be a challenge for SMEs as often the existing equipment cannot be simply replaced or data cannot be easily extracted from existing equipment. A system that automatically records downtime with minimal operator interaction can be beneficial by giving a clear picture of how a manufacturing process is running, along with providing information on duration, frequency and reasons for stoppages. When this information is available, further analysis can be performed to identify the main reasons for downtime and identify which sections of the production line are more prone to stopping; therefore, corrective actions can be put in place to reduce this. Off-the-shelf IoT equipment was used to develop this system, which reads the status from the signal towers of the line. These data were recorded in an SQL database and an interactive user interface was developed so that downtime codes could be assigned to stoppages and downtime data could be presented in different ways. This case study has shown that a small investment in IoT can make a huge improvement on the ability to monitor and analyse the downtime of a machining line for an SME.

Multi-Criteria Evaluation of Environmentally Friendly Alternative Fuels,"In order to fulfil the environmental goals set for the coming years, industrial companies are motivated to look for clean technologies and green solutions. Replacing common fuels in the transport sector can also contribute to the reduction of emissions. In this work, we focus on four alternative fuels. The main raw materials are hydrogen together with carbon dioxide or used cooking oil. We analysed seven technologies for low-emission hydrogen production. However, in such types of production, there are often problems with combining the environmental side with the economic one because they are usually in conflict. The solution can be found using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). Individual fuels were compared, as well as hydrogen production processes, using three criteria: minimum selling price, carbon footprint, and maturity of technology, in order to find the most suitable alternative. The main advantage of our MCDA approach is the objectivity of the final ranking. On the other hand, the complexity of this method also provides the possibility of the subjective choice of criteria preferences, which allows each decision maker to focus on their target of interest. Data-driven decision making also provides an opportunity to incorporate sensitivity analysis into our study.

The Impact of Iron Casting in Cupola Furnaces on the Environment,"The production of iron castings in cupola furnaces is a significant industrial process that has a notable impact on the environment. This paper examines and describes the environmental impact of this process, specifically focusing on the generation, characterization, and utilization of waste materials through data analysis and collection. Approximately one hundred and two million metric tons of castings are produced worldwide each year, with approximately one ton of foundry waste generated for every ton of castings. The slag from this waste can amount to as much as 7.14 million metric tons annually. Most of the slag ends up in landfills, which is expensive and represents a waste of this potential secondary raw material. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to utilize this waste in other processes or industrial sectors. Cupola slag, given its high phosphorus content, can be used as agricultural fertilizer or in the production of ceramic foam used in foundries as filters during casting. In the construction industry, slag can be used in the production of concrete as a partial substitute for fine aggregate. This concept not only mitigates the environmental impact of waste disposal, but also aligns with the circular economy concept, promoting resource efficiency.

The Valorization of a Crude Refinery’s By-Product: A Case Study on the Heavy Residue Gasifier,"The conversion of locally available, low-value materials to useful products and media, thereby replacing high-quality and high-cost resources, belongs to one of the pillars of the circular economy of industrial conditions. A study on the potential implementation of a mixed oxygen- and steam-blown heavy vacuum residue gasifier in a refinery, processing 5 to 6 million t of crude oil per year, is performed, evaluating its mass and energy balance, and identifying and assessing the synergies of gasifier placement in a refinery, rather than its erection as a stand-alone plant. Industrial heat and power plants, as well as hydrogen production plants, represent the production units that are directly affected by gasifier implementation, while several other technical and economic issues result in: the operation of the steam network, in heavy residues’ handling, and in the refinery’s natural gas balance. Natural gas is currently the most important resource for hydrogen production in the refinery, and its partial replacement by hydrogen from a gasifier has different energetic and environmental impacts, based on the considered natural gas composition (current situation: natural gas with 10% vol. renewable hydrogen and natural gas with 20% vol. renewable hydrogen content). The power production and the overall refinery’s power balance, the carbon dioxide emissions both within the refinery and external ones, and natural gas balance change are all evaluated. The preliminary results show that while gasifier commissioning is associated with an over EUR 1 billion investment, it can represent one of the few available solutions of how to reasonably dispose of heavy residues, utilizing it from both energy content and material potential point of views.

Determining Operating Parameters of an Electric Furnace for Casting of Bronze Age Replicas,"In previous work, a small electric furnace with a capacity of 3.5 kg of liquid copper, capable of reaching temperatures up to 1200 °C, and with nominal power input of 2.1 or 6.2 kW at 230 V was designed and constructed. The purpose of this furnace was to melt metals for casting replicas of historical weapons, tools, and jewellery from the Bronze Age. The theoretical operating parameters, such as electric energy consumption and the time required to melt the batch of metal, were derived from the design calculations. This study focuses on the experimental determination of the furnace’s operating parameters. Experiments were conducted to determine surface heat losses from the furnace, as well as electric energy consumption and the time required to melt aluminium and copper batches of various quantities during cold starts and continuous furnace operation. The data from these experiments were subsequently analysed to determine the thermal efficiency of the furnace and the cost of energy consumed for melting a batch under given conditions. The experimental results indicate that the furnace does not reach a steady state regarding heat transfer within the time required for melting a batch during cold starts. As a result, the surface heat losses are lower than initially calculated in the theoretical analysis. This leads to shorter required melting times, lower energy consumption, and lower energy costs for the batch compared to design values.

A Review of Machine Learning-Based Routing Protocols for Wireless Sensor Network Lifetime,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) grapple with a challenging and pivotal issue: how to maximize the network’s lifespan. To improve the quality of service (QoS) and extend the life of the network, there has been a lot of effort made in this area in recent years. The sensor nodes of a WSN are autonomous, dispersed devices that gather and direct data to a central hub, or “Base Station”, using wireless connections without any central coordinator. These networks have less processing power, memory capacity, power supply, and so on, which limits their range and battery life. Numerous studies preceding our research have proposed a myriad of strategies to enhance network longevity. In a WSN, information is relayed from one node to the next until it reaches the base station. Most nodes may be reliably expected to operate for the duration of their batteries. These strategies encompass reducing energy consumption, minimizing latency, load balancing, clustering, efficient data aggregation, and curtailing data transmission delays. WSNs may alter dynamically as a result of internal or external circumstances, necessitating a depreciating dispensable redesign of the network. Because the networks in classic WSN techniques are expressly programmed, it is difficult for them to respond dynamically.

Comparative Study on the Effect of Tool Wear on Turning Mild Steel and Stainless Steel with a Ceramic Tool Insert Using Taguchi Method,"Machining is a critical aspect of metalworking since it is used to cut metal. Machine tools, particularly cutting tools, are critical in metalworking for successful metal cutting. They have a significant role in developing distinct shapes and forms. Machining has become more crucial in modern automated manufacturing systems because of the massive upsurge in production time and the necessity to offset the high capital cost. Specifically, the Taguchi approach is used in this experiment because it uses an orthogonal array to investigate the parameters through a fixed number of experiments. In this case, three parameters (speed, depth of cut, and feed) were combined to produce nine possible result combinations. Stainless steel and mild steel are machined with the help of a ceramic tool insert with certain combinations. This is performed to estimate tool wear and surface roughness.

Worker Exposure to Hand-Arm Vibration in Fettling Shop: An Experimental Study in Foundry,"Hand-arm vibration is a significant occupational hazard commonly faced by industrial workers, particularly those in foundries engaged in fettling activities. The vibration exposure can result in various health problems, such as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS), carpal tunnel syndrome, and other musculoskeletal disorders. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate workers’ vibration environment and exposure levels to prevent such health issues. At first, the present study explored a different type of vibration exposure followed by vibration syndrome and vibration measurement methods. A case study was considered wherein the comparative analysis between pneumatic and swing grinders was performed between vibration magnitude, particularly in the fettling shop. The results revealed that the pneumatic hand grinder worker experienced a vibration magnitude of 3.6 m/s2 at 208 exposure points. In comparison, the swing grinder had a magnitude of 6.5 m/s2 at 668 exposure points for an 8 h workday. It can be noted that regulatory bodies such as ISO 5349 recommend an exposure vibration magnitude of 5 m/s2 for an 8 h workday and in the present context, these exposure levels were found to be higher than the standard limits. Accordingly, proper recommendations to sustain these levels within the limits are suggested. Such recommendations will protect workers from health hazards and help employers avoid costly compensation claims and legal liabilities. This study emphasizes the importance of addressing hand-arm vibration in the workplace for a safe working environment.

A Study on Mechanical Properties of Environmentally friendly Concrete Incorporating Banana Fiber and Banana Leaf Ash,"Modern research is increasingly focused on the use of sustainable materials in concrete to increase its mechanical properties in order to enhance its performance for different applications. Banana leaf ash has great potential to increase the compressive strength of concrete, whereas banana fiber has been reported to increase the tensile strength. Therefore, the combined effect of both these materials in concrete needs to be elaborated. This experimental study investigates the influence of a 1.5% proportion of banana fiber and partial replacement of cement with banana leaf ash (10%) on the mechanical properties of concrete. Compressive testing and split tensile testing were employed. The results of this study demonstrate that the inclusion of banana fibers and banana leaf ash results in decreased compressive strength and increased tensile strength. The decrease in compressive strength for FRC is 9.18%. On the other hand, the increase in tensile strength for fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) against plain concrete (PC) is 12.31%. The study provides valuable insights into the potential of banana-based additives in enhancing the performance of concrete, offering an eco-friendly approach for sustainable construction practices.

Effects of Tribology and Mechanical Properties on Silicon Carbide and Glass Fiber-Reinforced Hybrid Nanocomposites,"This study aims to enhance the mechanical and wear properties of hybrid nanocomposites by incorporating SiC nanoparticles and glass fibers into an epoxy resin matrix, utilizing a neural network for optimization. The mechanical properties were evaluated via flexural, impact, and wear tests. SiC nanoparticle concentrations were varied at three levels using the Taguchi technique. The results were optimized with the Taguchi signal-to-noise ratio approach. Regression analysis was used to determine the wear rate, flexural strength, and impact properties of the composites. SiC reinforcement significantly influenced the flexural and impact strength, along with wear resistance. The composition with 2% SiC showed a flexural strength of 95 MPa, while 4% and 6% SiC compositions exhibited strengths of 110.5 MPa and 125 MPa, respectively. The impact strength followed a similar trend. The wear test results demonstrated a decrease in the specific wear rate (Swr) and coefficient of friction (CoF) with an increasing SiC nanoparticle percentage. The optimal parameters were identified as 6% SiC nanoparticle loading, 15 N load, 160 RPM rotation speed, and a 40.2 mm sliding distance. The enhancement in impact strength is attributed to SiC nanoparticle reinforcement. The results were further refined using an artificial neural network for improved predictability. This research underscores the effectiveness of hybrid nanocomposites with SiC nanoparticles and glass fibers, as well as the potential of neural networks for process optimization, benefiting industries requiring high-performance materials.

Development of a Shape-Memory-Alloy-Based Overheating Protection System,"Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) are a class of metallic alloys that have the ability to return to their original shape after being deformed. NiTi (nickel–titanium) alloy a type of shape memory alloy that possesses unique properties such as remembering its shape, biocompatibility, and super-elasticity. These SMAs have the ability to deform when heated and regain their original shape when allowed to cool. The disadvantage of a fuse is that it can only be used once. By replacing a wire that melts with a NiTi shape memory alloy, we can turn it into a switch that opens when an excessive current (which leads to an increase in temperature of the wire) is applied. Magnets keep the circuit closed. When the wire heats up, the spring-shaped coil shrinks, which opens the circuit. The circuit can then be closed manually once the problems are rectified.

Comparative Performance Studies of Up- and Down-Milling on AA7075 Plate,"The monitoring of machining has been the focus of widespread research in recent years because of its substantial contribution to manufacturing process automation. To maximise productivity, the spindle speed and feed have been increased, which has increased noise and temperature generation in the workpiece and tool. Such loud noise levels are uncomfortable for the operators, create stress, and have negative health effects, which reduces productivity. Controlling the temperature and noise produced during milling is crucial. Among its several series, the aluminium alloy 7075 (AA7075) is one of the strong alloys utilised in aircraft structural components. Hence, the present work examines the effect of spindle speed, feed, and depth of cut on noise and temperature generation during the end-milling of an AA7075 plate with 0.25-inch thickness.

Experimental Investigation on the Mechanical Properties of Jute Fiber and Silica Nano Particles Using Artificial Neural Network,"This study explores the impact of silica nanoparticles on jute fiber-reinforced composites with epoxy resin matrices. Silica nanoparticles were synthesized at three concentrations (3%, 6%, and 9%) and incorporated into composites at varying fiber–resin weight ratios. The composites were subjected to tests for tensile strength, flexural strength, impact strength, and hardness. The Taguchi signal-to-noise ratio method was employed for optimization. Results indicate that a 9% addition of silica nanoparticles significantly enhances the mechanical properties of jute fiber-reinforced composites. Tensile and flexural strength increased with higher silica nanoparticle content, while impact strength and hardness also improved. Notably, a 9% silica addition achieved a maximum tensile strength of 72 MPa, resulting in a 10% increase over that yielded by the 3% addition. Flexural and impact strengths improved by 23% and 20%, respectively, when compared to the 3% silica addition. Furthermore, a neural network model accurately predicted the composite’s mechanical characteristics with 100% accuracy. These findings hold promise for the automobile and aircraft industries, as they require high-performance materials. The integration of jute fibers and silica nanoparticles into composites offers a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to conventional materials. The enhancement strategy employed in this analysis can be applied to enhance the mechanical properties of other composite materials.

Three-Dimensional Design and Prediction of Temperature Distribution of a Partially Ceramic Coated Piston Used in Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition Engine,"The goal of this research is to analyze the effects of a partial thermal barrier coating on piston temperature distribution in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines, which are investigated using La2Zr2O7 nanocoating with 1 mm thickness for numerical analysis. The thermal assessments of both conventional and coated pistons were performed using ANSYS V16. Engine testing was conducted on a single-cylinder, water-cooled CI engine for both the coated and conventional casings. According to the analytical results, the coated piston component’s surface temperature increased to 53 °C, which increased the temperature of the air–fuel mixture in the crevice and wall quenching zones. As a result, cold start HC emissions dramatically drop without impacting engine performance compared to normal engines. The maximum HC emission reduction over the standard engine was 43.2%.

An Insight into Harvesting Sustainable Electrical Energy from Sound Hazards Using Piezoelectric Materials,"The rapid growth of urban cities and industries has resulted in huge amounts of potentially harmful waste being released into the atmosphere. One form of hazard is noise/sound. Noise cannot be controlled in automobile industries and urban areas, which include traffic, railway stations, and markets. But it can be converted into a useful form through advanced material usage. One of the materials is piezoelectric material. Strain can be produced through vibration caused by sound, which, in turn, produces electrical energy. Hence, the objective of this research was to harvest electrical energy from hazardous sounds released from industries. Electrical energy was generated through systematic experiments using piezoelectric sensors. The experimental results revealed that the magnitude of 90 dB sound produced up to 2 volts through a single piezoelectric sensor. We can generate more energy by increasing the number of sensors as this material is cost effective. The numerical model was also effectively replicated and good agreement was obtained between the experimental and numerical frequency sound curves.

Exploring the Potential of Copper Slag and Quartz as Fine Aggregate Replacements in Concrete: A Comprehensive Study,"In the realm of civil construction, river sand is an essential ingredient that cannot be overlooked. With the ever-increasing surge in construction activities, the demand for river sand has surged in tandem, resulting in its escalating scarcity, and subsequently, its price surge across the entire nation. This study delves into the utilization of copper slag as a viable alternative in the production of cement mortars, particularly as a partial replacement for fine aggregates. Experiments were conducted on concrete cubes and cylinders to determine the compressive strength and split tensile strength, respectively. Five cubes and cylinders were tested after 7, 14, and 21 days of curing. The extensive characterization of copper slag was conducted, encompassing its chemical composition, mineralogical attributes, and size distribution. The findings highlight that mortars containing copper slag exhibit superior compression resistance compared to the river sand-based mortars. Specifically, the 50% replacement of river sand with a blend of copper slag and quartz demonstrates the highest strength, surpassing the other compositions. Notably, the partial substitution of sand with copper slag outperforms both quartz and sand individually, with the optimal strength achieved at a 50% replacement rate. Copper slag, with its pozzolanic properties, showed a greater strength-enhancing potential, while quartz also exhibited positive effects. These findings are promising for optimizing concrete mix designs, reducing the environmental impacts caused by industrial by-products, and exploring natural alternatives.

Evaluating the Wear and Mechanical Properties of Cotton Fabrics for Women’s Summer Clothing,"Recyclable yarn has become increasingly significant because of growing environmental consciousness and the necessity to acquire or enhance the qualities of woven materials in the years to come. A cotton yarn’s tensile strength, rip strength, and permeability to air were examined to obtain the intended outcomes. The experiment was carried out on specimens with almost identical structures, and the impact of the weaving and various weft materials was evaluated. This endeavor aims to find the right blend or blends of regenerated fibers to substitute 100% cotton garments. The mechanical strength and physiological characteristics of Tencel textiles mixed with other regenerate cellulose yarns were compared to those of 100% cotton to attain the same or possibly superior end qualities. Thus, cotton fibers, viscosity, Tencel, modal, and hemp were used. Standard thread counts of 20 tex were used to make mixed plain woven textiles made of 100% cotton and 50:50 mixes of Tencel with other regenerating materials. The ergonomic qualities, such as air permeability, and mechanical characteristics (tension and tearing assets, pilling, abrasion resistance, and warp- and weft-wise) were assessed. It has been discovered that textiles combined with Tencel perform better than cotton ones. Consequently, it may be said that 100% cotton textiles can be replaced with a Tencel combination, using these regenerating fibers.

"Mechanical, Moisture Absorption and Thermal Stability of Banana Fiber/Egg Shell Powder-Based Epoxy Composites","This study aims to explore the viability of adding a hybrid blend of eggshell and banana fibers treated with NaOH to improve the structural characteristics of epoxy composites. In order to determine their appropriateness for different applications, the study includes assessments of mechanical performance, water permeability, and heat transfer properties. Chicken eggshell was used to make calcined eggshell particulate (CEP), and bananas were used to obtain processed banana fibers (TBF). For the creation of bio-composites, NaOH-treated banana fiber (30 wt.%) was integrated into an epoxy matrix with different weight percentages of CEP (like 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 wt.%) through the hand layup with a vacuum backing technique. Examination of the data revealed that, in comparison to epoxy with no reinforcement, the addition of bio-fillers improved the thermal insulation (4 wt.% of CEP exhibits 0.052 W/mk), water absorption (4 wt.% of CEP produced 5.31%), flexural strength (20 wt.% of CEP exhibit 36.57 MPa), and modulus (12 wt.% of CEP exhibit 300.12 MPa) of the hybrids. This suggests that by lowering the conductivity of the bio-based composites, the inclusion of these bio-based reinforcements improved their thermal insulation ability. The resistance to temperature fluctuations is stronger when there is less thermal conductivity.

The 3D Taper Profile Machining of Superalloys and Composites Using WEDM: A Review,"Wire electric discharge machine (WEDM) is a process used popularly in microsystems, tool and die industries, medicine, transportation, and spacecrafts to create intricate portions with high dimensional accuracy and surface finish. It is employed to process superalloys and materials made of composites which are conductive and strong materials. From the literature, an analysis of the WEDM process on different materials revealed that there were many variables involved and that each process parameter influences the different response variables. The removal process of a spark discharge for an inclined angle during the cutting of 3D profiles has different applications. Also, types of dielectric fluid, and the influence of wire material, diameter and pressure, wire tension, feed, Ton, Toff, current, and voltage on machining characteristics—like kerf, MRR, wire wear, surface finish and its characteristics, dimensional deviations, and corner errors—and on a variety of materials like Inconel, nickel, titanium, WC, steels, and other superalloys and composites (MMCs and CMCs) during taper WEDM were reviewed.

Influence of Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes in Sulfur/Carbon Nanotube Composites Synthesized Using Solution Casting Method,"In this manuscript, we are reporting on the influence of MWNTs (multiwalled carbon nanotubes) on the structural, bonding, and surface morphological response on sulfur nanoparticles. Sulfur and multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites are formed using the solution casting method. The concentration of MWCNTs (0.01 and 0.05) and sulfur (0.99 and 0.95), respectively, was taken in weight ratios during fabrication of the composites. These fabricated composites have been characterized using XRD (X-ray diffraction), FESEM (field emission scanning electron microscopy), and FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) techniques. XRD spectra reveal that the crystallite size distribution was in the range of ca. 55 nm to 78 nm, as well as enhanced crystallinity upon increasing the concentration of MWCNTs in sulfur composites. Dislocation density and strain have been found to be increased in composites showing increased augmentation of MWCNTs (i.e., S95% MWCNT5%), while FESEM images confirm the uniform distribution of MWCNTs in sulfur composites, along with round structures at the nanoscale range. FTIR spectra depicted the bending and stretching of C-H bands. Composites with a higher concentration of MWCNTs show slightly more stretching vibrations. This indicates the further delocalization of electrons, which reveals that as MWCNTs’ concentration is increased, electrical conductivity enhances, showing that MWCNTs could perform better in electrical industries. The further delocalization of electrons also expresses that free electron–hole pair formation is better in composites with a higher concentration of MWCNTs, accounting for the fact that the photocatalytic response may increase in composites with a higher concentration of MWCNTs. Overall, it can be said that as the MWCNT concentration is ameliorated, the composites show a more crystallized structure with more vibrations. This characteristic of MWCNTs/sulfur composites is useful in photocatalytic response as well as in cathode materials in sulfur batteries.

Finite Element Study on Coconut Inflorescence Stem Fiber Composite Panels Subjected to Static Loading,"Natural fiber-reinforced composites (NFCs) are alternatives to synthetic fiber-reinforced composites, since they are abundant in nature, inexpensive, lightweight, and have a high strength-to-weight ratio. Natural fibers encompass a diverse composition, including lignin, hemicellulose, wax, and cellulose. Natural fibers are environmentally friendly, biodegradable, renewable, reusable, and sustainable. In bio-composites, natural fibers such as jute, banana, hemp, coir, kenaf, areca nut, and coconut inflorescence stem fibers, are blended with resin. Natural fiber-reinforced bio-composites have various applications in the construction industry, automobile industry, aerospace industry, sports equipment and gadgets, textile industry, and hotel industry. Fibers from natural sources are also used as reinforcements in composites, such as roofing sheets, bricks, door panels, furniture panels, and panels for interior decoration. The mechanical properties of natural fiber-reinforced composites are profoundly influenced by the bonding between the fibers and the matrix. This study involves the testing of compact tension (CT) specimens under mode I fracture conditions and employs three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) using ANSYS software to enhance our understanding of the material’s fracture behavior. Finite element analysis was performed on coconut inflorescence stem fiber-reinforced composite (CIFRC) panels with preformed cracks. Numerical simulation was carried out using ANSYS software. Properties such as crack growth initiation, stress-intensity factor, and stresses along the length of a CIFRC panel were examined using finite element analysis (FEA).

A Study of the Dynamic Stiffness of Flexible Couplings with a Rubber–Metal Element Type SEGME,"The dynamic characteristics of flexible couplings with a rubber–metal element type SEGME have been studied. The hardness of the rubber element of the SEGME 25 coupling is 53 Shore A, and that the SEGME 63 coupling is 73 Shore A, respectively. The experimental study was carried out in conditions of alignment of the connected shafts, and also at different levels of radial misalignment. The influence of an additional angular misalignment was investigated. The results show that, for this coupling type, the radial misalignments induce a downward nonlinear dependence on the dynamic stiffness. The presence of a small angular displacement in the shafts causes significant radial deformations. The sensitivity of the coupling decreases with the high hardness of the rubber element.

A Grey Wolf Optimisation-Based Framework for Emotion Recognition on Electroencephalogram Data,"Human emotions trigger reflective transformations within the brain, leading to unique patterns of neural activity and behaviour. This study connects the power of electroencephalogram (EEG) data to investigate the intricate impacts of emotions, considering their reflective significance in our daily lives, in depth. The versatile applications of EEG signals encompass an array of domains, from the categorisation of motor imagery activities to the control of advanced prosthetic devices. However, EEG data present a difficult challenge due to their inherent noisiness and non-stationary nature, making it imperative to extract salient features for classification purposes. In this paper, we introduce a novel and effective framework reinforced by Grey Wolf Optimisation (GWO) for the recognition and interpretation of EEG signals of emotion dataset. The core objective of our research is to unravel the intricate neural signatures that underlie emotional experiences and pave the way for more nuanced emotion recognition systems. To measure the efficacy of our proposed framework, we conducted experiments utilising EEG recordings from a unit of 32 participants. During the experiments, participants were exposed to emotionally charged video stimuli, each lasting one minute. Subsequently, the collected EEG data of emotion were meticulously analysed, and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was employed for the robust categorisation of the extracted EEG features. Our results underscore the potential of the GWO-based framework, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 93.32% in accurately identifying and categorising emotional states. This research not only provides valuable insights into the neural underpinnings of emotions but also lays a solid foundation for the development of more sophisticated and emotionally intelligent human–computer interaction systems.

Improvement in the Machining Processes by Micro-Textured Tools during the Turning Process,"The cutting fluid’s lubrication affects a workpiece’s surface finish and cutting tool lifespan during turning. To optimize machine performance, appropriate lubrication is needed. Empirical experiments examined how machining factors affected a redesigned single-point cutting tool. Texturing the tool’s rake surface without altering its physical qualities was achieved utilizing super-drilling and laser engraving technologies. The goal was to build a surface junction that would keep cutting fluid in contact with the tool longer, improving lubrication and cooling. Both standard and customized tools were used to compare cutting force, temperature, power usage, and surface polish. Magnified pictures from the scanning electron microscope were utilized to analyze tool wear in different places. The improved tool dramatically lowered mean cutting force, heat output, and power consumption in experiments. The textured tool produced continuous chips instead of discontinuous/burnt chips due to increased friction at the tool–chip interface. The updated tool improved lubrication and cooling with cutting fluid.

Eco-Friendly Adsorption of Cationic (Methylene Blue) and Anionic (Congo Red) Dyes from Aqueous Solutions Using Sawdust,"In this study, sawdust (SWS) was employed as an eco-friendly and low-cost adsorbent for the removal of anionic (Congo red, CR) and cationic (methylene blue, MB) dyes from aqueous solutions at 25 °C. The investigation encompasses various parameters affecting the adsorption process, including weight of sawdust adsorbent, pH, initial dye concentration, and equilibrium time. Characterization techniques such as Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were conducted for an in-depth understanding of the adsorption mechanism. Optimal conditions were found to be SWS weight of 0.1 g/L, dye concentration of 15 mg/L, and equilibrium time of 1 h. Under these conditions, removal percentages of 95.88% for MB and 67.78% for CR were achieved, with adsorption capacities of 14.35 mg/g and 10.22 mg/g, respectively. The results demonstrate that SWS, though considered waste, has significant potential as a low-cost adsorbent for dye removal from aqueous solutions. Removal efficiency increased with SWS weight, ranging from 75.54% to 98.50% for MB, and 50.86% to 80.012% for CR, while adsorption capacity (Qe) inversely correlated with surface weight, ranging from 45.55 to 9.12 mg/g for MB, and 15.23 to 8.076 mg/g for CR.

The Influence of Distance between the Electrode and Noise Reduction Buffer Amplifiers in ECG Monitoring Using Knitted Electrodes,"Knitted electrodes provide numerous advantages over the gel electrodes typically used in clinical practice when designing wearable Electrocardiogram (ECG) systems. They typically have enhanced durability, better textile integration and do not dry out. However, the higher skin/electrode impedance makes them susceptible to noise from electrical interference. Adding a buffer amplifier circuit close to the electrode, creating an ‘active’ electrode, is one way to mitigate this. However, the choice of where to integrate these amplifiers in the garment remains. Therefore, this work measured the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of an ECG output when comparing the distance between the electrode and the operational amplifier (op-amp) buffer and found that when the buffer was placed directly under a knitted electrode, the noise was lower than that seen with gel electrodes. This also provided information on the impact of distance on the SNR.

Multimodal Deep Learning in Early Autism Detection—Recent Advances and Challenges,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a global concern, with a prevalence rate of approximately 1 in 36 children according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Diagnosing ASD poses challenges due to the absence of a definitive medical test. Instead, doctors rely on a comprehensive evaluation of a child’s developmental background and behavior to reach a diagnosis. Although ASD can occasionally be identified in children aged 18 months or younger, a reliable diagnosis by an experienced professional is typically made by the age of two. Early detection of ASD is crucial for timely interventions and improved outcomes. In recent years, the field of early diagnosis of ASD has been greatly impacted by the emergence of deep learning models, which have brought about a revolution by greatly improving the accuracy and efficiency of ASD detection. The objective of this review paper is to examine the recent progress in early ASD detection through the utilization of multimodal deep learning techniques. The analysis revealed that integrating multiple modalities, including neuroimaging, genetics, and behavioral data, is key to achieving higher accuracy in early ASD detection. It is also evident that, while neuroimaging data holds promise and has the potential to contribute to higher accuracy in ASD detection, it is most effective when combined with other modalities. Deep learning models, with their ability to analyze complex patterns and extract meaningful features from large datasets, offer great promise in addressing the challenge of early ASD detection. Among various models used, CNN, DNN, GCN, and hybrid models have exhibited encouraging outcomes in the early detection of ASD. The review highlights the significance of developing accurate and easily accessible tools that utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to aid healthcare professionals, parents, and caregivers in early ASD symptom recognition.

The Effect of Metal Filler on the Mechanical Performance of Epoxy Resin Composites,"It is a common practice in the plastics industry to compound polymers with fillers to reduce the manufacturing cost and/or attain desired properties. By combining different fillers with various polymer matrices, polymer composites can be tailored to achieve property combinations which cannot easily be obtained from either the polymer matrices or the reinforcements alone. In the past decades, different metallic (Cu, Al, Steel, etc.) and ceramic fillers (SiC, Al2O3, CuO, TiC, TiO2, TiN, ZrO2, ZnO, ZnF2, SiO2, etc.) have been used as reinforcements in composite preparation because of their effectiveness in reinforcing polymers. In light of the above, this research is aimed at the fabrication and study of the basic mechanical properties of epoxy-resin composites filled with different weight percentages of metal filler. It includes the study of the mechanical properties of cast-iron-filler-reinforced epoxy-based polymer matrix composites. Epoxy composites containing cast iron in different weight percentages are prepared using casting technique. Data on neat epoxy are also included for comparison. All the tests were conducted at room temperature and according to ASTM standards. Density, hardness (Rockwell), tensile, flexural and impact tests were conducted, and the data were analyzed with the help of statistical charts to draw useful inferences. It was observed that the inclusion of cast iron filler affected most of the mechanical properties of neat epoxy. The density, hardness, impact strength, tensile and flexural properties of the developed composites exhibited a varying trend with respect to cast iron content. The increase in cast iron content showed significant improvement in tensile properties, hardness, impact strength and the density of the composites. The flexural strength was found to decrease at a higher cast iron content.

Calculation of Neural Network Weights and Biases Using Particle Swarm Optimization,"Various machine learning techniques and algorithms have been used to address, and are still being used to tackle, several real-world issues. One technique that has been extensively employed to address a variety of issues is the usage of neural networks. Neural networks can be used to classify data and to calculate regression coefficients. Backpropagation is the cornerstone of neural network training. The process of iteration involves changing the weight of a neural network in response to the rate of error observed in the preceding epoch. The error rates can be reduced and the applicability of the model increased, both of which will increase the model’s dependability. Artificial neural networks are commonly trained using the backpropagation approach, also known as backward propagation of mistakes. This technique aids in figuring out a loss function’s gradient for every network weight. The backpropagation method divides the dataset into training and testing sets. The neural network is assisted in performing exploration and exploitation using a variety of techniques. Among them are algorithms with biological inspiration. By using a different approach, bio-inspired computing can be distinguished from other traditional algorithms. Simple rules and individual life forms or swarms of individuals that adhere to those rules make up the ideology of bio-inspired computing. These living things, also referred to as agents, develop over time and advance with fundamental imperatives. This approach can be categorized as bottom-up or decentralized. In this paper, a neural network is created using weights and biases determined using the swarm’s individual particles. To compare a few parameters between the particle swarm optimization and backpropagation in neural networks, the Pima Indian diabetes dataset is employed.

Parametric Optimization of Solar Air Heaters Having Hemispherical Protrusion Roughness in the V-Notch Pattern on the Absorber Plate: A Metaheuristics Optimization Approach,"Artificial roughness in the form of protrusions has become a popular technique to improve the thermohydraulic performance of SAHs. So, utmost attention should also be given to determining the suitable parametric values that directly affect the performance of SAHs. Hence, in this work, an attempt has been made to optimize the performance of solar air heaters having hemispherical protrusion roughness in a V-notch pattern on an absorber plate using two different metaheuristic optimization algorithms, i.e., the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm and the dragonfly (DA) algorithm. This study makes use of the correlation equations for the friction factor (ff) and Nusselt number (Nu), which were developed after conducting the experiments. Four independent parameters, namely the Reynolds number (Re = 3600–21,700), relative protrusion height (ep/Dh = 0.027–0.069), relative pitch (p/ep = 6–14), and attack angle (αa = 15°–75°), were considered to obtain the optimal values of Nu and ff. In single-objective optimization, the maximization of Nu and the minimization of ff are two objective functions. The GWO has delivered the best solutions for both objectives with a faster computational rate and less variation. A convergence curve and box plot validated these findings. The maximum value of Nu was found to be 144.567, corresponding to Re = 21,700, ep/Dh = 0.07, p/ep = 8.54, and αa = 750, and the minimum value of ff was found to be 0.012, corresponding to Re = 21,700, ep/Dh = 0.03, p/ep = 14, and αa = 15°. Pareto multi-objective optimization provides compromised solutions that provide flexibility to the decision maker in selecting a parametric setting.

The various environmental factors that must be taken into account are temperature, wind direction, speed, as well as irradiation. The solar system’s standard test condition is never precisely attained outside. Because of this, it is necessary to take into account the seasonal influences to increase solar system performance in a real-time context. In the context of the Indian subcontinent, this research is especially important due to seasonal fluctuations in spectrum-related characteristics. The findings demonstrate that the multi-crystalline technology efficiency and output power evaluated for sites conform to the efficiency as well as output power anticipated using the temperature of the module. Under normal testing conditions, the solar PV module’s parameters are taken from the manufacturer’s datasheet. The accurate modeling of solar systems is necessary to address a variety of PV system problems. We may characterize a solar module’s electrical properties using this precise modeling technique to provide an accurate analysis of cell behavior under any operating situation. Three main stages must be taken into account while modeling a PV cell: the right selection of analogous models, the mathematical formulation of the model, and the precise identification of parameter values in the models. Therefore, in order to mimic the characteristics of solar modules, it is crucial to analyze and design relevant models, as well as use the right modeling technique.

Deep Learning-Based Coverless Image Steganography on Medical Images Shared via Cloud,"Coverless image steganography is an approach for creating images with intrinsic colour and texture information that contain hidden secret information. Recently, generative adversarial networks’ (GANs) deep learning transformers have been used to generate secret hidden images. Although it has been proven that this approach is resistant to steganalysis attacks, it modifies critical information in the images which makes the images not suitable for applications like disease diagnosis from medical images shared over cloud. The colour and textural modification introduced by GANs affects the feature vector which is extracted from certain image regions and used for disease diagnosis. To solve this problem, this work proposes an attention-guided GAN which transforms images only in certain regions and retains the originality of images in certain regions. Due to this, there is not much distortion to features and disease classification accuracy.

The Electrochemical Oxidation of the β-Blocker Drug Propranolol in Biomimetic Media Consisting of Surface-Active Ionic Liquid and a Conventional Cationic Surfactant on a Glassy Carbon Electrode,"Electrochemical studies of the drug and micellar aggregates of surfactants have gained interest in recent years. The aggregation of micelles aims to mimic the structures of biological membranes. It also helps to regulate the pharmacokinetic properties of medicines as they offer a path for formulations with controlled release abilities. Propranolol (PPL) is a beta blocker drug which is used as a medication in treatments for hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and atrial fibrillation, and it is also used to prevent migraines. The electro oxidation of Propranolol was observed using a glassy carbon electrode in cationic surfactants and ionic liquid surfactants with the same chain length using cyclic voltammetry. A well-defined single irreversible peak was found in the potential range of 0.6 to 1.6 V at room temperature. In this paper, Propranolol, in the absence and presence of both the surfactants, is discussed in terms of the pre- and postmicellar phases. The scan rate and effects of both concentrations were evaluated in the presence and absence of surfactants in biphasic surfactant conditions. Diffusion-controlled and irreversible processes involving an adsorption effect were observed in both the surfactants. The interactions of PPL in the presence of different cationic micelles provide an effective approach for estimating the stability of radicals in biological mimetic systems.

Investigation of Nano-Composite Dampers Using Different Nanomaterials in Civil Engineering Structures: A Review,"Civil engineering structures need to be protected from earthquakes, representing a new area of research that is growing continuously and very rapidly. Design engineers are always searching for lightweight, stronger, and stiffer materials to be applied as vibration-damping materials. Stability in dynamics necessitates an active, robust, and convenient mechanism that can absorb the kinetic energy of vibration to prevent the structural system from resonance. Recently, many researchers have successfully used nanomaterials to develop energy-absorbing materials that are lightweight and cost-effective. Traditional damping treatments are based on combinations of viscoelastic, elastomeric, magnetic, and piezoelectric materials. In this paper, a review of various damping techniques for composites made of cement modified by various nanomaterials like Nano Al2O3 (Aluminum Dioxide), Nano SiO2 (Silicon Dioxide), Nano TiO2 (Titanium Dioxide), Graphene, and CNTs (Carbon Nanotubes) is presented. The designs of various nano-composite dampers are presented to strengthen the information progress in this field. The current study’s goal is to discover how nanoparticles impact the cement-based material’s damping properties. The study examined several nanomaterials in cement composites at differing concentrations. With the help of the Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) method and the Logarithmic Decrement approach, the damping properties of these composites were examined. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the effects of nanomaterials on the microstructure and pore size distribution of the composite. Increasing the quantity of nanoparticles in cement paste may improve its capacity to lessen vibration. The experiments also showed that certain nanomaterials may improve load transmission inside the cement matrix and connect neighboring hydration products, helping to reduce energy loss during the loading process. These nanoparticles will eventually replace the large machinery employed to dampen vibrations in buildings due to their small weight, increased mechanical strength, and effective damping properties.

A New Approach for Carrying Out Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Comments Using Natural Language Processing,"Business and science are using sentiment analysis to extract and assess subjective information from the web, social media, and other sources using NLP, computational linguistics, text analysis, image processing, audio processing, and video processing. It models polarity, attitudes, and urgency from positive, negative, or neutral inputs. Unstructured data make emotion assessment difficult. Unstructured consumer data allow businesses to market, engage, and connect with consumers on social media. Text data are instantly assessed for user sentiment. Opinion mining identifies a text’s positive, negative, or neutral opinions, attitudes, views, emotions, and sentiments. Text analytics uses machine learning to evaluate “unstructured” natural language text data. These data can help firms make money and decisions. Sentiment analysis shows how individuals feel about things, services, organizations, people, events, themes, and qualities. Reviews, forums, blogs, social media, and other articles use it. DD (data-driven) methods find complicated semantic representations of texts without feature engineering. Data-driven sentiment analysis is three-tiered: document-level sentiment analysis determines polarity and sentiment, aspect-based sentiment analysis assesses document segments for emotion and polarity, and data-driven (DD) sentiment analysis recognizes word polarity and writes positive and negative neutral sentiments. Our innovative method captures sentiments from text comments. The syntactic layer encompasses various processes such as sentence-level normalisation, identification of ambiguities at paragraph boundaries, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, text chunking, and lemmatization. Pragmatics include personality recognition, sarcasm detection, metaphor comprehension, aspect extraction, and polarity detection; semantics include word sense disambiguation, concept extraction, named entity recognition, anaphora resolution, and subjectivity detection.

Current Measurement and Fault Detection Based on the Non-Invasive Smart Internet of Things Technique,"Graphing the consumption of daily essentials like electricity and water is crucial for minimising waste and estimating per-user usage in light of the modern-day data acquisition rally for a better understanding of customer consumption and patterns. Traditional methods of electrical measurement require the involvement of a trained professional, while more advanced alternatives can be prohibitively expensive or offer limited customisation options. We address the cost factor, flexibility, and complexity issues by using a non-intrusive clamp current transformer around power lines to measure current, estimate power, and upload it to the cloud with proper statistical data. For domestic and industrial applications, the filtered and referenced outputs are read by a low-cost CPU (ultra-low power) equipped with Wi-Fi, an analog-to-digital converter, and Bluetooth capabilities, which then determines the apparent power with an accuracy of 0.37 to 0.8%. Nonlinearity varies from 0.2% to 0.3% as a function of increasing current; nonetheless, offsets are imperceptible under typical operating conditions. Safety in the event of a sudden, large change in the current profile is one of several factors that determine the current measuring limit, together with the rating of the current transformer utilised and other related filtering, reference, calibration, and coding criteria. Our goal is to make the power consumption statistics accessible on the move at little cost by simplifying the circuit and coding of traditional metres. It is smart in that no hard coding is required to send credentials across routers, and fault signals are detected and relayed in accordance with an algorithm. User-specific servers save data for monitoring and conserving energy usage; users do not need to consult specialists or put their own security at risk. Data are acquired from the power line and sent to the cloud where statistical functions are performed to increase insight into consumption and failure. It has impressive range and accuracy in terms of power and current for residential and business applications.

"Comparative Evaluation of the Antimicrobial Efficacy of Sodium Hypochlorite, Silver Nanoparticles, and Zinc Nanoparticles against Candidal Biofilm: An In Vitro Study","The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate and compare the antifungal activity of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), silver nanoparticles (Ag-NP), and zinc nanoparticles (ZnO-NP) against candidal biofilms. Twenty-two single-rooted premolars were decoronated to a root length of 12 mm. Shaping of the canals was done with ProTaper size F2 files. The specimens were inserted into vials containing 2 mL of the Sabouraud broth and then incubated for 14 days. From n = 22, one sample was subject to SEM evaluation, and from one more sample, dentinal shavings were taken on a Sabouraud dextrose agar plate to confirm the presence of candidal biofilms. The remaining 20 samples were divided (n = 5) and irrigated as follows. Group 1: saline; Group 2: 5.25% NaOCl; Group 3: 0.02% Ag-NPs; Group 4: 0.02% Zn-NPs. The CFUs (colony forming units) were determined per group. SEM imaging of one sample per group was undertaken to correlate the microbiological results. Statistical analysis was conducted using Kruskal–Wallis, with p < 0.05 kept as the significant level. NaOCl reduced the colony counts to a maximum, which was of statistical significance, followed by Ag-NP and Zn-NP. Saline showed the least antimicrobial efficacy. NaOCl was the most effective irrigant against candidal biofilms. Ag-NPs and ZnO-NPs reduced the fungal load but failed to eradicate the biofilm completely.

A Study on the Suitability of Constant Boundary Elements for the Simulation of Biological Organs,"In the process of designing of surgical simulators, it may be a requirement to simulate biological organs in real-time. About thirty computations per second are required for achieving real-time graphics. Hence, computational techniques employed to simulate biological organs in real-time should be able to perform about thirty computations per second. The computational techniques employed should be fast enough, but at the same time should be accurate enough to realistically simulate the biological organs which are inherently nonlinear. A numerical technique called the Boundary Element Method (BEM) is generally thought of as being faster when one compares the technique with some well-established numerical techniques like the Finite Element Method (FEM). This technique (BEM) is even faster if constant boundary elements are employed. However, the BEM is mostly used to simulate linear behavior, whereas the FEM is more established for simulating nonlinear behavior. The present work investigates whether biological organs may be simulated by using the linear BEM. The reason nonlinear BEM has not been used is that the nonlinear BEM is quite slow and difficult to implement. A human kidney is the biological organ considered in this work. A nonlinear analysis and a linear analysis are carried out on the kidney. A nonlinear analysis is carried out by using the FEM, whereas the linear analysis is carried out by using the BEM. Results from the nonlinear analysis are compared with the results from the linear analysis. The results indicate that there is good agreement between the results from the linear BEM and the nonlinear FEM many times, but there is considerable difference between the results other times. Although the results reinforce the idea that the BEM could be a useful tool while simulating biological organs, further research is needed to definitively say whether the results given by the linear BEM, which uses constant boundary elements, are always good enough for simulating biological organs.

Investigation on the Acoustic Performance of Micro-Perforated Panel Integrated Coiled-Up Space Acoustic Absorber,"Recently, increased attention has been given to minimize the effects of noise pollution on living beings. The attenuation and manipulation of sound waves with low-frequency components are quite difficult with traditional absorbers due to inherent properties induced by large wavelengths and yet are particularly critical to modern designs. In this study, a parallel arrangement of a coiled-up space cavity and micro-perforated panel (MPP) is considered as the absorber configuration. The coiled-up space consists of a front panel with an orifice and a rigid backing panel enclosing an arch-shaped concentric channel. The entire coiled-up space length is provided with two varying cross-sections. By this arrangement, the sound path is squeezed into a reasonably small volume enabling sound absorption at low frequencies. A thin panel with numerous perforations is the main constituent of MPP. It is backed by an air cavity and terminated by a rigid backing. Here in this configuration, micro perforations are provided on the front panel of the coiled-up space, which ensures simultaneous entry of acoustic waves into the micro-perforations and coiled-up space structure. The absorption characteristics of the present configuration are studied numerically and analytically. The combined structure with parallel combination of coiled-up space and MPP resulted in the abatement of more than 70% of sound in the frequency range of 321 Hz to 853 Hz. The present absorber has only a 5.5 cm thickness, which is subwavelength λ19 also.

A Review of Recent Developments in 6G Communications Systems,"Currently, we exist in the 5G division of the wireless technology cycle, where the standardization is complete and deployment is being carried out. However, 5G networks do not have the capacity to deliver an automated and intelligent network that supports connected intelligence. 6G is what enables this, and globally, countries are aiming to lay the foundation for the communication needs of 2030. This brings out a very key question and discussion on how wireless communications will develop in the future, particularly adapting to the range and set of applications and user cases. Industry and academic efforts have started to explore beyond 5G and uncover 6G as 5G becomes more internationally accessible. We forecast that 6G will undergo a transition that is unheard of in the history of wireless cellular systems. 6G exists beyond mobile internet and will be required to support omnipresent AI services from the network’s core to its endpoints. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) will be crucial for developing and improving 6G designs, protocols, and operations. URLLC plays a crucial role in next-generation communication systems, particularly in 6G, for applications requiring ultra-low latency and reliability. These services support cutting-edge technologies like driverless vehicles, remote robotic surgery, smart factories, and augmented reality applications. URLLCs ensure robust connectivity and real-time responsiveness, enabling time-sensitive and safety-critical services in 6G communication infrastructures. This article illustrates the importance of URLLCs in 6G and their integration with deep learning, the security challenges, and their potential solutions.

Comparison of Different Machine Learning Algorithms to Classify Epilepsy Seizure from EEG Signals,"Recurrent seizures are a symptom of a central nervous system disease called epilepsy. The duration of these seizures lasts less than a few seconds or sometimes minutes. There are very few ways to record seizures, and one of them is EEG. EEG systems mainly consist of scalp electrodes that record electrical activity. These EEG data are often complex signals containing noise and artifacts. Accurate classification of epileptic seizures is a major challenge, as manual seizure identification is a laborious and challenging endeavor for neurologists. An automated method for seizure detection and categorization was required to address this issue.

Cognitive radio networks (CRNs), alternatively known as dynamic spectrum access networks, are comprised of multiple CR nodes and are frequently referred to as next generation (XG) communication networks. These XG communication networks are expected to offer high-speed data transmission capabilities to adaptable users through a variety of wireless architectures and dynamic access protocols. Since CRNs share similarities with traditional wireless networks but operate in an external wireless medium, they are more susceptible to various types of attacks compared to their wired counterparts. This vulnerability stems from the fact that wireless media can be intercepted or exploited, potentially leading to channel congestion or data interception. This paper presents two key approaches: the node evaluation and selection (NES) algorithm and the secure spectrum sensing mechanism, which incorporate the user’s interaction history and connection distance, that are recorded in a public ledger and managed by a blockchain management system. The proposed algorithm facilitates the central aggregation point for selecting nodes with outstanding performance for cooperative sensing, thus enhancing the network’s security against malicious node attacks.

Navigating the Divide: Digital Kiosks and Mobile Apps as Complementary Human-Centered Self-Service Technologies,"This work sheds light on the effectiveness of digital kiosks in targeting specific audiences in contrast to centrally managed mobile phone applications. To this end, we have conducted a case study where a digital kiosk was developed to support the academic activities of the computer science department. Our results show that the students continue to use the mobile phone application. However, the digital kiosk added the following main benefits to the service: Firstly, being in a physical location and thanks to their larger screens, digital kiosks are ‘eye-catching’ devices, which makes them ideal for advertising products/services or communicating relevant information. Secondly, they are brilliant points of attraction. By seeing other people standing in front of any of them, members of the target audience are encouraged to imitate them, even if they did not have the intention to do so. Thirdly, even if the services are available from a mobile phone application, some people do not wish to create an account, download and install the application on their devices, and/or give permission to it, which can potentially invade their privacy and security. Lastly, and equally important, digital kiosks are human-centered technologies that can be more appealing to people who seek social interactions. With this, we conclude that digital kiosks cannot replace mobile phone applications. Rather, they are further technologies that enhance self-service overall.

"Biocompatibility and Performance of Dental Composite Restorations: A Narrative Review on Free Monomer Release, Concerns and Solutions","The use of resin-based dental composites is multiplying through the years due to the increased demand for tooth-colored restorations. The choice of monomers strongly determines the viscosity, reactivity, mechanical property, water sorption and polymerization shrinkage of the composite material. It is desirable for all monomers to be converted into polymers (Degree of Conversion), but this does not occur clinically, resulting in a poor prognosis for restorations as well as an increase in systemic health risks. The release of monomers occurs due to erosion and degradation, as well as the release of leachable species from the restoration. The potential toxicity of free monomers to dental pulp cells is concerning. Free monomers are not only allergens but also have reported cytotoxic and genotoxic effects. Various methods and practices have thus been employed to counter the ill effects of free monomer release from dental composite restorations for better safety and healthy oral cavities.

In most cases, the operation of conventional commercial heat exchangers is considered under steady-state flow conditions with relatively slowly varying parameters. Another situation is observed in Stirling engines, where the working fluid flow mode is characterized by significant changes in pressure, density and flow rate, the direction of which changes twice per cycle. These circumstances significantly complicate the design of regenerators and other heat exchangers for Stirling engines. The results of a theoretical and experimental study of recuperative heat exchangers in the Stirling engine system and possible ways to improve the efficiency of heat transfer in order to increase power and efficiency are considered in this article. A method of comparative evaluation of heat exchange surfaces efficiency is proposed under conditions of their operation in the engines with external heat supply system.

Gamepad Design for Touch Generation: Evaluation of First-Person Shooter/Third-Person Shooter Game Control and Possibility of Touched-Based Control as Norm,"This research compares a Steam controller, a DualSense controller, two gestures on a prototype touchpad-implemented gamepad design, an iPad Pro, a Logitech G304 mouse with latency matching the iPad, and a Razer 8K gaming mouse using Fitts Task 2, 3D Aim Trainer for a performance and gameplay experience test in a Death Stranding firing range and gathers feedback on the devices. With the participants categorized by their gaming experience, the differences between the experienced groups are recorded in terms of performance and preference. The average result shows that the touch-based input has the potential of substituting a mouse when the latency condition is equal, and the players that already have touch-based FPS/TPS gaming experience tends to favor touch over a mouse input. However, the prototype controller designed to implement a larger touchpad did not meet the expectations in terms of performance and preference, but the knowledge, data and feedback gathered in this study will aid future touch-based gamepad designs in the emerging handheld console market.

Development of Gas Dynamic Nozzles: A Preliminary Computational Study,"The design and optimization of supersonic nozzles are of great interest in aerospace and propulsion system applications. Designing and maintaining a mechanically simple nozzle would be beneficial over the complex nozzles that are currently in use. A detailed simulation-based study was conducted to design a virtual nozzle that produces the same effect as a traditional nozzle while using simpler geometries and secondary air injection. Secondary air injection is widely used for fluidic thrust vectoring. Because such a nozzle is operated by varying the thickness of the boundary layer, it is possible to control the effective throat area, and hence, achieve a variety of exit pressures and Mach numbers by just varying the input momentum ratios (or pressure ratios). A similar concept was kept in mind, and various geometries, such as flat-plate geometry, divergent geometry and convergent–divergent geometry, were tested for different jet pressure ratios, numbers of jets, locations of the jets and geometric parameters of the virtual nozzle. The main objective of the work was to achieve an exit Mach number of 2 from a subsonic flow. The lengths of various geometries and the input pressure ratios were altered iteratively based on the findings obtained in each test case. All of the results attempted to acquire the required exit Mach number while accounting for numerous complexities in fluid flows, such as shock waves, vorticities, etc. Although the desired Mach number is not achieved, this study establishes a strong foundation and an idea that has the potential to revolutionize propulsion systems and create nozzles that are mechanically simple, weigh less and do not require any actuating mechanisms to operate.

An Internet of Things-Enabled Self-Stabilizing Spoon for Patients with Parkinson’s Disease,"The second most frequent type of neurodegenerative sickness is Parkinson’s disease, which impairs daily functions and movement in older people due to significant nerve cell destruction. The patient may experience uncontrollable shaking and hand tremors as their condition worsens, making it difficult for them to carry out routine chores, such as eating from a bowl. In this project, we want to build a stabilising spoon for individuals with Parkinson’s disease by using the concepts of sensor networks and the Internet of Things. The stabilising spoon senses any inadvertent tremors or shivers from the user and modifies its head appropriately, ensuring that the spoon’s bowl stays stable at all times. A prototype was developed using an accelerometer to monitor motion speed, as well as a gyroscope to estimate angle in order to assist patients throughout the eating process.

The Effectiveness of Lighting Design for Improved Patient Care Considering Energy Conservation,"Unquestionably, hospital patient rooms require a proper lighting design. Dissimilar to cultural and artistic settings, where artistic discourse on light has significant importance, in medical settings, the most crucial conversation refers to standards. Research indicates that light in hospital settings has an impact on a patient’s physical and mental health. Effective lighting in medical settings can enhance the hospital’s positive experience and the speed at which patients recover from their diseases. It can also increase staff attentiveness and productivity. It is also critical to consider reducing electricity consumption in hospital settings that require lighting 24/7. Due to the high cost of lighting, access to natural light in combination with time-of-day controls minimizes energy consumption when daylight is available and impacts the hospital’s bottom line. The effect of light on hospital users was investigated in this article; therefore, it is important to understand both natural and artificial light sources in this regard. Natural light has many benefits for humans, and when it comes to electricity consumption, it is the best method because it is a free source; but, since natural light is not always available and cannot be used throughout the day, there is a need to have an artificial light source that gives the best lighting effect in terms of visual comfort and visual performance for users. Secondly, proper artificial light sources can reduce electricity consumption; hence, these two critical aspects were underlined in this study.

The Characterization of Deformable Photovoltaic Modules,"The system under investigation is a deformable photovoltaic–wind hybrid system which utilizes both solar and wind energy by combining PV modules with a vertical-axis wind turbine. This system contains 5 PV modules separated by 72° angles; these modules are attached to the blades of the vertical-axis wind turbine. This leads to each module receiving a different amount of solar irradiation, which affects the generated output power. In this study, the VOC and ISC of the modules were measured against different factors that influence the output power, including factors such as solar insulation, module temperature, module tilt angle θ, and module azimuth angle ϕ. These measurements were entered into the MATLAB curve fitter to produce a model of each parameter. The results showed that as the tilt angle θ decreased from the default, the VOC increased slightly, while ISC increased significantly. And when the module temperature increased, VOC decreased significantly, while the ISC increased slightly. The results of the study showed that by changing the module tilt angle and module azimuth angle, the solar insolation received at the module surface changed, which leads to different VOC and ISC values. Also, this study showed that the VOC and ISC values varied with time.

Nonlinear Behavior of Cold-Formed Steel Columns: Investigating the Influence of Stiffener on Strength and Buckling Resistance,"Steel structures are widely employed in the construction industry because of their simplicity, speed of construction, and ease of handling. Cold-formed steel is becoming more popular in the construction industry as the sections are created using thin-gauge sheets, as a result of which the weight of the structure is reduced. This saves a lot of steel compared to normal steel structures, providing cost benefits and material savings. Finding a cross-section that is both cost-effective and able to carry more weight without buckling presents a challenge. The objective of this investigation was to analyze the effects of a stiffener on the behavior of cold-formed steel columns. An experimental study was carried out on two long columns made of cold-formed steel with back-to-back lipped channel sections—one with stiffener and the other without stiffener. A finite element model was developed and validated using the experimental and theoretical results. The theoretical investigation was based on the direct strength method and effective width method using IS codes. From the results, it was observed that intermediate V-shaped web stiffeners improved the distortional and local buckling strength. A non-linear behavior of the stress–strain curve was observed. The applied stiffener did not increase the dimensions or required material of the section, but the results predicted an increase in strength of 32%. This model could be further utilized for various parametric studies and more effective sections could be achieved.

Novel Natural Bee Brick with a Low Energy Footprint for “Green” Masonry Walls: Mechanical Properties,"The present research delves into the experimental investigation of the mechanical properties of bee bricks, which serve as nesting habitats for solitary bees. The study aims to provide valuable insights into the efficacy of these bricks as eco-friendly alternatives emphasizing a low energy footprint. It is designed as a masonry unit to provide nest sites in urban or civil areas to order to protect and contribute to the reproduction of solitary (wild) bee pollinators. The invention concerns the solid structural and architectural material of masonry bricks, which have different sizes of cavities and constitute a natural habitat for various solitary bee species. It is an innovative material that can be used as a building material in both new constructions and existing masonry structures. At the same time, it can be used as a decorative material in gardens, nurseries, fields, the courtyards of houses, schools, and buildings in cities; it can even be used in “green” and sustainable buildings. To protect bees, it is necessary to address the threats mentioned above. The results indicate that the physical materials composed a high-performance product with a remarkable compressive strength of 12 MPa and 13 MPa in loading directions perpendicular and parallel to the bed joint, respectively. Simultaneously, despite the smooth surface, the bee brick presented respectable adhesive properties proving that this product is appropriate and can be proposed as a masonry unit for safe seismically designed structures. Furthermore, the direct shear results indicate that the low strength of the binder mortar as well as the bond strength of the masonry unit and the mortar play a significant role. Overall, this presents awareness about the reduction of biodiversity and, at the same time, a proposal of the dual use of the construction material for the construction of load-bearing masonry and a biotope needed for the reproduction and protection of pollinator bees.

Research on INS/GNSS/UWB Adaptive Robust ESKF Kinematic and Static Filtering Based on Cost Function,"Multi-source autonomous navigation-dependable decision making has a crucial impact on the overall performance of navigation systems. To solve the problem of overall system robustness caused by the intelligent-dependable decision making difficulties of navigation systems from different sources, on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) as the carrier, a new multi-source fusion algorithm based on cost function is proposed in this paper. The algorithm uses INS/GNSS/UWB as the sensor data source and is solved by using error-state Kalman filter (ESKF)-based kinematic and static multi-source filtering. After the RSS, positioning residual and positioning stability are selected as parameters and weighted, and the cost function is constructed. The structure of the filtering can be adapted according to the cost function in complex environments. Through mathematical simulation and comparative experiments, the positioning accuracy of the algorithm is improved by 75.9% and 74.44%, respectively, compared to federated filter and traditional ESKF-based kinematic and static filtering. It also improves the reliability, decision-making ability, and robustness of multi-source autonomous navigation system.

Computer-Aided Simulation Analysis on the Impact of Various Opening Patterns in High-Rise Opening Building towards Pollutants Dispersion,"Taiwan is the fourth most urbanized country in Asia, where the urban spatial structure of high-rise and density hinders urban ventilation. Studies have proven that opening buildings reduce the area of windward surfaces, which can effectively mitigate the urban heat island effect and disperse pollutant accumulation. Until now, most researchers have discussed the differences in heights and sizes of openings in the opening buildings, but few discussed the influence of opening patterns on urban ventilation. Thus, we set the building unit to 30 × 30 m with 160-m height with the opening height as tall as 0.45 times the building height and a 9% opening rate, distributed in 6 × 6 ideal city configuration Four cases (case A: no opening, case B: middle square, case C: right square, and case D: middle rectangular) with different arrays of opening buildings were compared with ANSYS Fluent v18 to simulate the wind environment and NO2 pollutants. The results showed that the opening building improved the permeability of street ventilation and air circulation, which greatly increased the wind speed at a height of 72 m. The distribution of pollutants was affected by the distance from the pollution source and the width of the street. Pollutants were gradually dispersed as the height increased. Case D of a long-narrow rectangular opening (adjacent to the pedestrian floor) and the venture effects formed eddy currents above and below the opening, which effectively improved the ventilation in the street canyon. Therefore, it had the best wind speed on the pedestrian level among the cases. The wind speed of the 72 m-high floor was much higher than that of case A, and the vortex generated by the airflow flowing through the opening in the street canyon increased the diffusion effect of pollutants. Overall, the opening building with a rectangular opening was the optimum solution in terms of wind speed improvement and pollutant removal. In addition to the opening design in the building facade, it is recommended to provide sufficient open space to improve air circulation in the building block and disperse pollutants.

The designed model is working between 2.5 and 3 GHz by producing bandwidth value of 500 MHz and 4–5 GHz with a bandwidth value of 1000 MHz. The designed antenna polarization is linear, and the radiation is non-directive. The performance bandwidth is 4:1, 2:1, and 5:1 at 2.5, 2.6, and 4.5 GHz and the gain value is 2.3 dB, 2.9 dB, and 5.1 dB, respectively.

Utilization of Hydrogen-Containing Gas Waste from Deep Oil Refining at a Hybrid Power Plant with a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,"The article is devoted to the issues of the utilization of hydrogen-containing gas wastes in oil refining deep processing. Gas wastes consist of hydrogen, methane, ethane, propane, butane, other saturated and unsaturated C5-C7 hydrocarbons, sulfur compounds, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and oxygen. The use of a hybrid power plant for efficient conversion of the potential energy of the gas mixture into electrical and thermal energy is proposed. It is shown that gas waste from oil production has a net calorific value comparable to the calorific value of natural gas (46 and 49 MJ/kg, respectively). Fuel gas is a valuable product that can be used after desulfurization instead of burning in the atmosphere. The article proposes the developed composition of the adsorbent for hydrogen sulfide capturing, including 40% wt. bentonite, 40% wt. calcium oxide, 10% wt. zinc oxide and 10% wt. manganese oxide. The capture rate was 98.3%.

"Design Implementation of Trapezoidal Notch Band Monopole Antenna for LTE, ISM, Wi-MAX and WLAN Communication Applications","This article analyses & describes a trapezoidal dual-band monopole antenna. The notch band monopole disables 4.4–5.7 GHz commercial communication equipment. The basic type operates at 2.5–4.4 GHz with a 500 MHz marginal bandwidth and 5.7–7 GHz with a 1000 MHz bandwidth. Present research optimises multiband trapezoidal antennas. Trapezoidal antennas improve multi-band wireless antennas. GSM, LTE, Wi-Fi, and 5G frequency bands start design. Inefficient and space-wasting, traditional antennas lack frequency range. Benefits of trapezoids: changing trapezoidal element sizes and angles enables the antenna to transmit many frequencies, sloping trapezium sides allow impedance changes without networks or tuning, numerical calculation and electromagnetic modelling optimise the trapezoidal antenna’s performance throughout the communication band, impedance matching, gain, and radiation efficiency provide transmission reliability, and broadband trapezoidal forms eliminate band-specific antennas & switches. Simplified antenna integration makes modern devices cheaper and simpler. In multiband applications, trapezoidal antennas outperform normal antennas. The antenna fits numerous wireless communication devices and systems due to its modest size and wide band coverage. The redesigned structure with notch increases operating band bandwidth and notches application bands between 4.4–5.7 GHz. By modifying trapezoidal geometry, we generate selective impedance transition notches to target crucial interference frequencies. Modern wireless communication systems with complicated interference situations can trust its careful engineering to provide good efficiency and radiation patterns across a wide frequency band while actively rejecting interfering signal. The peak realized gains obtained at 2.5 GHz is 2.4 dB, at 3.4 GHz it is 3.5 GHz and at 5.8 GHz it is 4.7 dB.

Because of the outstanding image quality and lack of ionising radiation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely employed in medical imaging. Artificial Intelligence provides an easier way to interpret these MRIs, which is otherwise a tedious and time-consuming task. Deep learning networks and convolutional neural networks have been very good in the detection of brain tumours. In this work, the authors employ deep-learning transfer techniques for the classification of brain tumours. The VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Inception v3 models with CNN pre-training have been utilised by the authors to predict and categorise brain tumours automatically. Using a dataset of 7023 MRI brain tumour images divided into four different classifications, pre-trained models are shown to be effective.

A novel antenna design known as the “M-shaped Conformal Antenna with FSS Backing for Gain Improvement” makes use of both the conformal structure and FSS technology to increase gain. The geometric shape of the M-shaped antenna, which might resemble the letter “M” or a collection of M-shaped parts, is what gives it its name. This structure can be created to alter the antenna’s resonance frequency, increase bandwidth, or adjust the emission pattern. The radiation pattern of the antenna may be precisely controlled by combining an M-shaped construction with an FSS. You may customize the radiation pattern to concentrate energy in particular directions or sectors, boosting gain and coverage, when necessary, by modifying the FSS’s geometry and physical characteristics. The combination of features makes it extremely ideal for a variety of applications where optimum gain is a crucial need, such as aerospace, communications, and radar arrays. It also enables fine control of the radiation pattern, frequency-selective gain, and interference elimination.

Optimization of Performance and Emission Responses of Common Rail Direct Injection Engine by Taguchi-Grey Relational Analysis Technique,"India imports fossil fuels to meet its energy needs, and the need is anticipated to increase over the coming years. The constant usage of crude fuel will initiate its depletion in due course, necessitating the hunt for substitute fuels. One of the most promising alternatives to fossil fuels is determined to be biofuels. Fuels made from second-generation feedstocks, particularly non-edible oils, may change the game in this situation. The use of Simarouba non-edible oil as a substitute for diesel in common rail direct injection (CRDI) engines is the subject of the current piece of research. Running a CRDI engine with Simarouba biodiesel blends may not be suitable under the same operating conditions as running a diesel engine. To optimize performance, the ideal conditions for operating a CRDI engine with Simarouba biodiesel mixes needs to be discovered. The control settings in this study that affect the engine’s performance viz., fuel temperature (FPT), fuel injection pressure (IP), and injection time (IT) are designed using the Taguchi technique. Under full load conditions of 12 kg, for the biodiesel blends viz., SB5, SB10, and SB20, studies were conducted using the Taguchi L9 orthogonal array (OA). Through experimentation, performance and emission responses were obtained. For analysis, six engine responses were considered. The analysis shows that each response is uniquely impacted by the engine control parameters. Therefore, it might be challenging to pinpoint the ideal circumstances that would improve performance and lower emissions. Thus, this presents an example of a multi-response optimization problem. For this reason, multiple response optimization uses Taguchi-Grey Relational Analysis (TGRA). According to TGRA, the ideal settings to increase engine performance while using Simarouba biodiesel blends as fuel are an FPT of 40 °C, an IT of 21° bTDC, and an IP of 600 bar.

Design of a Singing Evaluation System of Heyuan Hua Chao Opera Based on Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients,"Heyuan Hua Chao opera is affected by modern culture and is facing a limited number of teaching staff, little time available for teachers to be dispatched, a small scope of popularity, the inability for continuous tracking in teaching, unsystematic and coherent learning among students, and difficulty of independent learning. Therefore, the voice feature parameters required for the evaluation model were extracted through MFCC coefficient features and later input into a convolutional neural network to generate data sets and training sets. These feature-labeled sets are segmented to output singing feedback. With a comprehensive overview of the artistic characteristics of Hua Chao opera singing and the research and interviews conducted by the Hua Chao opera heritage development center and local people, a system is designed to evaluate the singing voice of Hua Chao opera singers based on the MFCC. The aim is to effectively help students participate in learning and intelligently evaluate their learning effects. The model can be applied to other opera repertoires to promote the preservation and dissemination of traditional opera culture.

Age-of-Information-Based Transmission Protocol in Vehicular Network,"With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and communication networks, the concept of a smart city emerged spontaneously. In the traffic control of a smart city, the vehicular network plays an important role. If the driving information of vehicles can be collected from the vehicular network and then aggregated into a smart city system, traffic control facilities can be adjusted in real time to improve traffic or increase traffic safety. This study is based on WAVE/DSRC under the IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609 standards. When the vehicle is moving, the On-Board Unit (OBU) on the vehicle and the Roadside Unit (RSU) transmit data through the 5.9 GHz (5.85–5.925 GHZ) frequency band to establish vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication (V2I). The immediacy of the transmission of beacon messages is also discussed over a vehicular network. A beacon message is essential for communication in a vehicular network, including various safety messages, such as driving directions, driving speed, and location. We introduce the Age-of-Information (AoI) indicator to reflect the immediacy of information. AoI is used for the elapsed time after the sender samples the message until the receiver receives the message. We propose a centralized AoI-based protocol and a decentralized AoI-based protocol. By using Random-Walk and SUMO, we simulate driving dynamics and various RSU setting scenarios. Finally, we verify the performance of the proposed AoI-based protocol through experimental simulations.

Urban Traffic Flow Prediction Using LSTM and GRU,"For smart cities, the issue of how to solve traffic chaos has always attracted public attention. Many studies have proposed various solutions for traffic flow prediction, such as ARIMA, ANN, and SVM. With the breakthrough of deep learning technology, the evolutionary models of RNN, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) models, have been proven to have excellent performance in traffic flow prediction. By using LSTM and GRU models, we explore more features and multi-layer models to increase the accuracy of traffic flow prediction. We compare the prediction accuracy of LSTM and GRU models in urban traffic flow prediction. The data collected in this study are divided into three categories, namely “regular traffic flow data”, “predictable episodic event data”, and “meteorological data”. The regular traffic flow data source is the “Vehicle Detector (VD) data of Taipei Open Data Platform”. Predictable episodic event data are predictable as non-routine events such as concerts and parades. We use a crawler program to collect this information through ticketing systems, tourism websites, news media, social media, and government websites and the meteorological data from the Central Meteorological Bureau. Through these three types of data, the accuracy in predicting traffic flow is enhanced to predict the degree of traffic congestion that may be affected.

Performance Evaluation of Various Ni-Based Catalysts for the Production of Hydrogen via Steam Methane Reforming Process,"Steam methane reforming (SMR) approaches are highly recognised and pivotal in industrial H2 production, contributing over 40% to global hydrogen production. The prime objective of this study is to optimise the significant parameters involved in the SMR process to achieve the utmost conversion of CH4 to H2. To attain this, a sophisticated one-dimensional unsteady-state heterogeneous plug flow reactor (PFR) model was methodically constructed and simulated using the Aspen HYSYS V11 software. The study comprises an exhaustive comparison of seven diverse sets of catalysts, primarily categorised based on the different weight percentages of Ni in Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, along with various promoters incorporated to enhance the conversion rate in the SMR process. This comprehensive evaluation identifies the most operative catalyst configuration for optimising CH4 conversion. The results obtained through the simulations revealed that CH4 conversion intensifies with an increase in temperature, while it weakens with higher pressures within the catalyst set considered for the study. The analysis yielded promising conclusions by comparing the simulated CH4 conversion percentages at various temperatures with data from the existing literature. The maximum absolute error encountered was only 3.72%, signifying the accuracy and reliability of the developed model. Moreover, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) calculated was a low 1.42%, suggesting the robustness of the proposed approach. The findings lay the foundation for future innovations and improvements in the field, ultimately fostering more efficient and sustainable hydrogen generation. As the demand for clean energy grows, the optimisation of the SMR process becomes increasingly vital, making this study a crucial step towards meeting global energy needs while minimising environmental impact.

Performance Enhancement of Aged Mineral Oil by Blending Synthetic Ester for Transformer Insulation Applications,"Mineral oil derived from petroleum is the most preferred liquid insulation and coolant in power and distribution transformers because of its stability at high temperatures, as well as its excellent electrical insulating properties. Since it is non-biodegradable and inflammable, an alternative insulating liquid should be developed, or a possible approach should be established, to further utilize the aged mineral oil in the existing transformers to avoid the problem of discarding the oil. Though natural esters look like a promising alternative, they suffer from excessive oxidation which makes them unsuitable for transformer insulation applications. This work presents the feasibility of blending aged mineral oil with synthetic ester to extend its life. Both fresh and aged mineral oil were blended with synthetic ester separately using ultrasonication after the removal of moisture content. The electrical, thermal, and physiochemical characteristics of the blended oil were studied by measuring breakdown voltage, flash and fire points, and viscosity, respectively. These characteristics varied depending upon the ratios of mineral oil and synthetic ester. The optimum ratio of synthetic ester and mineral oil for enhanced performance was found as 1:4 for both fresh and aged mineral oils. This adds an advantage of reduced synthetic ester requirement and, thus, reduced cost. A comparison of results also revealed that the optimum ratio of mineral oil and synthetic ester depends on the ageing condition of the oil, electrical, physiochemical, and thermal properties of the blended oil. The results also proved that the aged mineral oil can be reused after blending it with synthetic ester, which avoids discarding the oil.

Investigation of Machining Parameters and Surface Quality of AZ-31 Magnesium Alloy Subjected to Spark Machining,"Magnesium alloys are commonly used in various industries such as automotive, aerospace, electrical, medical, sports, etc. The material is preferred in the making of engine blocks, transmission cases, and structural parts due to its unique material properties, like being lightweight and durable. It also offers a good strength-to-weight ratio and directly contributes to the fuel efficiency of vehicles. Due to its usage in various industries, it is essential to understand its behavior under machining. But the machining of magnesium alloys can present significant challenges compared to other conventional structural metals and alloys. The research work focuses on investigating the application of a Plug Electrical Discharge Machine (EDM) for machining the AZ-31 magnesium alloy and aims to analyze the surface quality of the machined surface for selected input parameters. The experiments were conducted on a mirror-finished flat specimen while keeping the incision depth and servo voltage constant at 0.3 mm and 45 V, respectively. A copper tool was used to make nine unique incisions on the surface using selected values of pulse on-time (Ton), pulse off-time (Toff), and current (I). A surface analysis using optical microscopy revealed that the surface roughness increased drastically with a combination of high values of I, Ton, and Toff. The tests conducted using a profilometer confirmed the proportional relationship between the input parameters and the surface roughness of the AZ-31 magnesium alloy.

Hydrothermal Synthesis of Mesoporous FeTiO3 for Photo-Fenton Degradation of Organic Pollutants and Fluoride Adsorption,"Metal oxide semiconductor-based photocatalysis and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are effective in treating various recalcitrant pollutants such as organic dyes present in industrial wastewater streams. AOPs rely on the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH•) that facilitate the non-selective destruction of most organic pollutants. Here, we present the novel synthesis of mesoporous FeTiO3 catalyst via a simple, hard template-free, aqueous-solution-based hydrothermal synthesis method. The surfactant, tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB), was used as the structure-directing agent, the removal of which led to the formation of the mesoporous structure. The catalyst was characterized by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Branauer–Emette–Teller analysis (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques. The obtained catalyst has been studied for its photocatalytic application in the presence of H2O2 towards the degradation of organic dyes as representative pollutants, namely, rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) under direct solar light irradiation. The various characterizations confirm the formation of mesoporous FeTiO3 with a pore size of ≈7.5 nm and a specific surface area of 65 ± 5 m2/g. The influence of H2O2 oxidant on the removal of the said dyes has also been studied at various concentrations in the presence of the synthesized catalyst to determine the optimum dosage of H2O2. The catalyst was efficient in the complete synergistic adsorption-led photo-Fenton-like removal of MB in just 30 min of irradiation time, while the 96% RhB was degraded in 240 min. Moreover, this catalyst has also shown potential for fluoride adsorption that reaches up to more than 50% in 90 min.

Biomaterials: A Sustainable Solution for a Circular Economy,"A few of the reasons behind the introduction of the concept of biomaterials, such as biopolymers to address problems like plastic pollution, include a lower reliance on fossil resources, reduced carbon emissions, a focus on non-renewable resource allocation, and, most importantly, promoting a circular economy. The high production cost is a hindrance in scaling up the production and market for biobased and biodegradable plastics, but microbial production of such monomers or polymers using easily available and inexpensive substrates, like waste streams, can be seen as a potential strategy to overcome this challenge. These polymers, with properties similar to conventional plastics, can be applied as alternatives in different sectors. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate change now requires immediate mitigation. Looking at this need, the construction industry has started using biobased materials to focus on reducing CO2 emissions. Similarly, the improved barrier, mechanical, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties; biocompatibility; and biodegradability of biomaterials like PLA, PHA, etc., make them suitable for various other sectors. The present paper will focus on highlighting the multi-functionality of such biobased materials that will further open many opportunities for significant innovation.

Histopathological Image Analysis Using Deep Learning Framework,"Breast cancer has the highest mortality rate. Therefore, histologic imaging evaluations must detect breast cancer early. Traditional methods are time-consuming and limit pathologists’ skills. Breast cancer histopathology picture segmentation is neglected by existing HIAs because of its complexity and lack of historical data with exact annotations. Histopathology breast cancer images are classified using graph-based segmentation. Graph-segmented images retrieve relevant features. Using recursive feature removal, breast cancer photographs are categorized. Breast cancer symptoms can be detected by appropriately classifying breast histopathology scans as abnormal or normal. Modern medicine diagnoses and predicts diseases, including cancer, using histopathological image analysis. Due to picture identification and feature extraction, deep learning can automate and improve histopathological image analysis. This study extensively analyses deep learning frameworks in histopathology image analysis. Starting with histopathological image interpretation’s challenges, this study emphasizes the intricate patterns, cell structures, and tissue anomalies that demand professional attention. It then examines CNNs, RNNs, and their variants’ design and ability to catch subtle features and patterns in histopathological images. We examine tumour detection, grading, segmentation, and prognosis using deep learning in histopathology. For each problem, this article evaluates cutting-edge deep learning models and approaches to demonstrate their accuracy and efficiency. While training deep learning models for histopathology image analysis, this study tackles data collection, preprocessing, and annotation. We also analyse automated clinical systems’ ethical and regulatory ramifications. Deep learning-based histopathological image processing case studies show patient care and applications. Multi-modal data fusion, transfer learning, and explainable AI may increase the accuracy and interpretability of histopathological image analyses.

Experimental Investigation of Two- and Three-Blade Savonius Hydrokinetic Turbine for Hydropower Applications: A Study across Various Turbine Positions from Channel Centre to Channel Wall,"Hydrokinetic energy has gained significant attention in recent years as a promising renewable energy source due to its low environmental impact and potential for use in remote locations. This research aims to optimize the performance of the Savonius hydrokinetic turbine, a crucial component of zero-head hydropower systems, for efficient renewable energy extraction from flowing water. Laboratory-scale experiments with two and three-blade Savonius turbines at different channel positions investigate geometric dimensions and design parameters like the power coefficient (CP) and Torque coefficient (CT). The experimental results are compared with previous research, confirming the superiority of the two-blade configuration, which achieved CP and CT at the same TSR and channel locations. Specifically, the two-blade Savonius turbine demonstrated a CP of 0.27 and a CT of 0.37 at TSR 0.7 and the channel’s centre placement. Placing the turbine at the channel centre yields the best performance for both configurations. This study provides valuable insights for enhancing the efficiency of hydrokinetic turbines, contributing to renewable energy technology advancements, and addressing climate change and energy security challenges.

End-of-Life Stage Analysis of Building Materials in Relation to Circular Construction,"This article is focused on analyzing roof structure from environmental impact indicators and circularity point of view. The life cycle analysis of the roof structure includes the product phase, transport from the factory gate to the site, operational energy and operational water phase, and an end-of-life phase. Three end-of-life scenarios for built-in materials are designed to observe the reduction in environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of the structure. Scenario 1 mainly considers waste incineration, which accounts for almost 77% of the end-of-life phase. In addition, landfilling (15.4%) and recycling (7.7%) are considered. In scenario 2, landfilling accounts for 38.5% and incineration also accounts for 38.5%. Recycling (15.4%) and downcycling (7.6%) are also considered. In scenario 3, recycling and reuse represent 46.1% and 38.5%, respectively. Incineration (7.7%) and downcycling (7.7%) are also considered. The lifetime considered is 50 years and the functional unit is 1 m2. One-Click LCA software was used for the analysis. Results for GWP-fossil are 415 kgCO2eq, 381 kgCO2qe and 362 kgCO2eq for scenarios 1, 2 and 3. The circulation score of the roof composition for three scenario is determined to be 2%, 16% and 36%. It can be concluded that the end-of-life phase of the materials influenced these results to a large extent.

Strength and Durability Properties of Geopolymer Mortar Made with Concrete Waste Powder,"With each passing season, the need for sustainability is growing exponentially. This target of sustainability can only be achieved by innovation in new materials and technologies. Geopolymer binders are innovative materials that can replace cement and play a vital role in attaining sustainability in infrastructure. This paper discusses the effective utilization of Concrete Waste Powder (CWP) as a binder to assess the strength and durability properties of geopolymer mortar. Herein a CWP was partially replaced with Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) at different replacement levels of 0%, 10%, and 20%. The alkaline solution for geopolymer mortar was made from sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate solutions. For all geopolymer mortar mixes, 0.45 alkali/binder ratio, 12 molarity (M) of sodium hydroxide, 2 of sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide ratio, and 0.35 of water/solid were kept constant. The strength property in terms of compressive strength and durability was accessed in terms of water absorption and porosity of all geopolymer mortar mixes at both ambient and heat curing conditions at 7 and 28 days. The presence of silica, alumina, and calcium in CWP makes it a potential binder for geopolymer mortar. The results suggest that increasing the substitution of GGBS with CWP improves the strength and durability of geopolymer mortar mixes by providing appropriate calcium content along with a geopolymer reaction. The compressive strength increases and water absorption and porosity decrease significantly with a 20% content of GGBS. The utilization of CWP in the production of geopolymer mortar sourced from concrete waste can help to achieve a sustainable environment.

The main objective is to find antecedents of intentions that drive people to visit green hotels using the theory of planned behavior (TPB). This study will focus on millennials as they represent a major part of the consumption economy, having higher disposable income. A preliminary study was conducted using a questionnaire survey, and 35 responses were received. Structural equation modeling was performed to analyze the relationships. Measurement model analysis was performed to validate the instrument and structural model analysis was conducted for hypothesis testing. Collected data were analyzed using SmartPLS V4.0. Findings revealed that subjective norms have a significant impact on customers’ attitude (β = 0.374, p < 0.001) but not much influence on perceived behavioral control (β = 0.218, p > 0.1). Customers’ attitude (β = 0.609, p < 0.001) was found to significantly influence their green purchase intention; PBC (β = 0.242, p > 0.1) did not influence customer’s green purchase intention. Findings also confirmed that attitude is a crucial variable impacting customers’ green purchase intention to visit green hotels. Having a favorable attitude toward saving the environment will have a positive influence on customers’ intention to select a green hotel. This study highlights the factors impacting millennials’ intention to visit green hotels i.e., attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. The study’s findings can be put to use by hoteliers to design sustainable strategies to build environmentally viable hotels and create awareness among the millennial generation to contribute towards sustainable tourism. This can also be utilized to gain a competitive advantage for hotels to market them as a differentiating factor in the highly competitive tourism industry. The government can utilize the findings to develop sustainable infrastructure for protecting the environment.

"Fractal-Enhanced Microstrip Antennas: Miniaturization, Multiband Performance and Cross-Polarization Minimization for Wi-Fi Applications","Due to the fast advancement of technology and industry, miniaturization has become an important research area. Also, all wired systems are shifting into wireless, and thus, there is a need for antennas to transmit and receive data in and out of gadgets. Fractal geometries provide many benefits when used to manufacture microstrip antennas, including features like size filling, multiband, low profile, and compact size. In this study, four fractal antennas, the Sierpinski carpet, Sierpinski gasket, circular patch, and Koch fractal, were designed. Three iterations of the above four antennas were completed. The size of the antennas was 20 mm × 26 mm × 1.6 mm. FR4 epoxy with a full ground was used here for antenna generation. These antennas can be used for 5 GHz band wireless applications. They provide a good return loss at 5.2 GHz. The maximum return loss was achieved using the Koch fractal at its 3rd iteration of −39.85 dB with a gain of 3.6 dB. In order to reduce cross-polarization, a square slot was added in all antennas’ feed lines, and cross-polarization was reduced by up to 60 dB. For simulation purposes, Ansys-HFSS, using FEM for the analysis of complex EM problems, provided accurate results. Also, 3D and 2D radiation patterns were analyzed, and it was found that they were directional in nature with low radiation toward the back side.

Continuity versus Desertion in Pandemic Times: The Management of Engineering Schools in a Peruvian Private University via Big-Data Analysis,"The main consequence of the arrival of COVID-19 was the application of social distancing, which mainly had implications regarding the economies of affected countries. This affected students, whose economy was weakened because of social restrictions. Therefore, private universities that depend strongly on the continuity of students had to face some difficult periods, with an eventual increase in desertions. In this way, the general managers’ offices had to find new and consistent directions for correct decision making without reducing the quality of the service. This paper presents a scheme that was applied in a private university in the south of Lima city during the period of 2020–2021. It is shown that the usage of a set of variables and their combinations to make a decision only appears to be relevant if a such decision is free of either external or internal noise. The results exhibit a minimization of 70% in the potential number of desertions in 2021 due to the gained experiences of 2020.

Weighted Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms and Power Management Strategies for Grid Hybrid Energy Systems,"In independent renewable energy systems (RESs), one of the primary concerns needing to be addressed is the maintaining of power balances between supplies and requirements that are cost-optimized in residences linked to these systems. The amount of power generated through RESs has substantially risen, with solar and wind being the two primary sources in RESs. In modern power systems, small-scale distributed networks are growing at a rapid pace and distributed generation (DG) plays an important role. Micro grids are very recent additions to electrical infrastructures. Power management is primarily required for smooth operation, maintaining consistency, and robustness, as well as controlling the actual and reactive power of independent DG. However, the batteries are expensive; moreover, during the charging and discharging process, huge amounts of power are lost, characterizing important problems which have to be averted. This paper introduces the weighted particle swarm optimization (WPSO) method for controlling energy systems and grid hybrid energy systems that comprise photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine, batteries, and diesel generators. By maximizing the power derived from RES and reducing battery power usage, energy is preserved, and the cost of energy consumption (energy of diesel) is reduced. Meteorological data from Spain were used in this study’s simulations. The method depends on the data forecast of renewable energy one day in advance and the everyday load power consumption profile. The results of the simulation show that WPSO outperforms existing algorithms in terms of energies, costs, and battery lives.

Hybrid Feature Selection and Classifying Stages through Electrocardiogram (ECG) Signal for Heart Disease Prediction,"Diseases are major causes for increasing mortality rates. Clinical data analysis must predict cardiovascular disease. Machine learning (ML) may aid decision making and prediction using the healthcare field’s massive data set. ECG demonstrates electrical activities in human hearts, and variations in signals’ morphologies have provided improved knowledge of different types of arrhythmia depending on the state of the heart. In order to accurately forecast cardiac disorders, this study effort proposed a hybrid feature selection model and classification together with the ECG wave graph. QRS waves, which are time intervals of binary data, can be determined using the suggested technique of determining the ECG signal’s time interval from R-peak levels to the next level using double squared differences in signals. This approach involves many rounds of data sorting for decreasing noise, thresholding an ECG difference signal by examining the time interval between QRS, and then comparing relative magnitudes to identify the area of interval processing to evaluate accuracy results. In order to choose the best features, a modified chicken swarm optimization algorithm (MCSO) was proposed. Aberrant waves caused by cardiac ailments impacted the dataset patients, according to the suggested research’s unique machine learning methods of multi-module neural network system (MMNNS).

Computer-Aided Simulation on the Impact of the Combination of High-Rise Building Wall and Roof Green Coverage Ratio on Urban Microclimate,"Environmental issues related to global warming and urbanization are becoming more serious. Many studies have shown that urban vertical planting can effectively reduce ambient temperature. However, the impact of different vertical planting combinations on urban microclimate has rarely been studied in Taiwan. Thus, in this study, the impact of different proportions of green walls and green roofs on the environment is explored. Referring to 6 times 6 high-rise buildings of 90 m in the ideal city. FLUENT was used to simulate the average climatic conditions of the Taipei Station in the past ten years’ summer. Since the actual building has openings that cannot reach 100% vertical plant coverage, the coverage is calculated based on the proportion of the green coverage area to the area of bare walls and roof decks. We had four options, including case 1 without greening, case 2 (green wall 25% + green roof 75%), case 3 (50% green wall + 50% green roof), and case 4 (75% green wall + 25% green roof). The research results show that at the height of the pedestrian layer (1.5 m), the wind speed of urban streets is reduced due to the obstruction of surrounding buildings. The installation of wall greening slows down the wind speed and reduces the ambient temperature, which is better than roof greening. In the urban canopy (90.5 m), as the Z-axis height increases, the higher the green roof ratio, the higher the wind speed. To improve the overall urban wind below 100% of the total greening balance of walls and roofs, it is recommended that wall greening be 50–75% and roof greening be 25–50%.

Very-Long-Wavelength Infrared Range Type-II Superlattice InAs/InAsSb GaAs/Immersed Photodetectors for High-Operating-Temperature Conditions,"Recently, there has been significant interest in type-II superlattice (T2SL) infrared detectors based on both InAs/GaSb and InAs/InAsSb material systems, and fully operating devices have been presented in the mid- (MWIR) and long-wavelength (LWIR) infrared ranges. In addition, theoretical simulations and experimental reports show high-performance T2SL devices in the very-long-wavelength infrared range (VLWIR) (cutoff wavelength, λc ≥ 12 μm). Devices in this wavelength range are essential for space-based applications. In VLWIR, the existing detectors with satisfactory performance are extrinsic silicon detectors operating under heavy, bulky and short-lifetime multistage cryocoolers. These disadvantages are mainly critical for space applications, and thus, developing a device exhibiting a higher operating temperature (HOT) is of high priority. We report on a photoconductive T2SL InAs/InAsSb detector with λc > 18 μm (limited by a GaAs substrate) and high-operating-temperature (HOT) conditions (T = 210–240 K) grown on thick semi-insulating GaA substrates by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).

Sustainable Power Prediction and Demand for Hyperscale Datacenters in India,"Data localization, data explosion, data security, data protection, and data acceleration are important driving forces in India’s datacenter revolution, which has raised a demand for datacenter expansion in the country. In addition, the pandemic has pushed the need for technology adoption, digitization across industries, and migration to cloud-based services across the globe. The launch of 5G services, digital payments, big data analytics, smartphone usage, digital data access, IoT services, and other technologies like AI (artificial intelligence), AR (augmented reality), ML (machine learning), 5G, VR (virtual reality), and Blockchain have been a strong driving force for datacenter investments in India. However, the rapid expansion of these datacenters presents unique challenges, particularly in predicting and managing their power requirements. This abstract focuses on understanding the power prediction and demand aspects specific to hyperscale datacenters in India. The study aims to analyze historical power consumption data from existing hyperscale datacenters in India and develop predictive models to estimate future power requirements. Factors such as server density, workload patterns, cooling systems, and energy-efficient technologies will be considered in the analysis. Datacenter negatively impacts the environment because of the large consumption of power sources and 2% of the global contribution of greenhouse gas emissions. Given the increasing cost of power, datacenter players are naturally encouraged to save energy, as power is a high datacenter operational expenditure cost. Additionally, this research will explore the impact of renewable energy integration, backup power solutions, and demand–response mechanisms to optimize energy usage and reduce reliance on conventional power sources. Many datacenter providers globally have started using power from renewable energy like solar and wind energy through Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) to reduce these carbon footprints and work towards a sustainable environment. In addition, today’s datacenter industry constantly looks for ways to become more energy-efficient through real innovation to reduce its carbon footprint.

Design and Implementation of Hardware-Implemented Dual-Axis Solar Tracking System for Enhanced Energy Efficiency,"This paper concentrates on the development of a closed-loop tracking of the sun that precisely follows the sun’s trajectory, allowing photovoltaic panels to capture the maximum amount of solar energy. Azimuthal and elevation-tracking mechanisms are included in the proposed system, and a feedback controller based on sensors monitors the brightness of the sun continuously as a reference signal. The controller generates a signal to operate the tracking motor with two axes, orienting the PV panel towards the sun, when the intensity exceeds a set threshold. In both east–west (E-W) and north–south (N-S) directions, the solar tracking system (STS) tracks the sun’s position independently. A dual-axis solar tracking system (DAST) was made of three 335-watt panels (each generating 1 kilowatt of power) in a PV system. Three 335-watt panels were used to successfully execute the dual-axis solar tracking system, with each panel contributing to the PV system’s overall power generation of 1 kilowatt. Overall, the PV system integration of a dual-axis solar tracking system with three 335-watt panels shows the potential for higher power output and energy efficiency. This configuration offers a viable means of maximizing the advantages of renewable energy sources and efficiently harnessing solar energy.

Experimental Analysis of Feature-Based Image Registration Methods in Combination with Different Outlier Rejection Algorithms for Histopathological Images,"Registration involves aligning two or more images by transforming one image into the coordinate system of another. Registration of histopathological slide images is a critical step in many image analysis applications including disease detection, classification, and prognosis. It is very useful in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) and allows automatic analysis of tissue images, enabling more accurate detection and prognosis than manual analysis. Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of histopathological images, registration is challenging and requires the careful consideration of various factors, such as tissue deformation, staining variation, and image noise. There are different types of registration and this work focuses on feature-based image registration specifically. A qualitative analysis of different feature detection and description methods combined with different outlier rejection methods is conducted. The four feature detection and description methods experimentally analyzed are Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB), Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Key points (BRISK), KAZE, and Accelerated KAZE, and the three outlier rejection methods examined are Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), Graph cut RANSAC (GC-RANSAC), and Marginalizing Sample Consensus (MAGSAC++). The results are visually and quantitively analyzed to select the method that gives the most accurate and robust registration of the histopathological dataset at hand. Several evaluation metrics, the number of key points detected, and a number of inliers are used as parameters for evaluating the performance of different feature detection–description methods and outlier rejection algorithm pairs. Among all the combinations of methods analyzed, BRISK paired with MAGSAC++ generates the most optimal registration results.

Predicting Employee Turnover: A Systematic Machine Learning Approach for Resource Conservation and Workforce Stability,"A company’s most valuable resource is its workforce, which includes each worker. Because of the crucial role that employees play in the success of an organization, measuring employee turnover rate has become one of the most important metrics that businesses are concentrating on in the modern era. Attrition may occasionally arise owing to unavoidable circumstances such as moving to a distant place, retirement, etc. But when attrition begins creating holes in the pockets of an organization, it is necessary to monitor the situation closely. When hiring new staff, a company must use a significant quantity of its available resources. The process of rehiring employees needs to be eliminated, and a strong workforce needs to be maintained, so it is necessary to adapt the analysis of systematic machine learning models. From these models, a suitable model that gauges the risk of attrition may then be selected. This not only helps an organization save money by preserving its resources but also assists in preserving the status quo of its staff.

Modeling of Barriers to the Adoption of Autonomous Vehicles: DEMATEL Method,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to increase safety while reducing energy use, pollution, and traffic congestion, to name a few positive effects. Industries, however, are having trouble implementing AVs. The goal of this study was to pinpoint and analyze the obstacles preventing the widespread use of AVs. To do this, a comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to identify the barriers, which were later confirmed by a panel of experts. There were five issues that needed to be addressed: a lack of infrastructure, funding limitations for manufacturing, low customer acceptance, security breach concerns, and potential employment effects. After these barriers were decided upon, the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory method was chosen to model them. The DEMATEL approach makes use of the expertise of groups and experts while relying on matrix tools and graph theory. It develops a visual framework that emphasizes the causal connections between various factors. A DEMATEL digraph is also presented which helps to identify which barrier is the most crucial barrier. Priority ranking was applied to the identified barriers and categorization of barriers was also performed in this study. Two categories were formed, namely, cause and effect barrier categories. Based on the results of DEMMATEL, the lack of funds for manufacturing AVs and the lack of infrastructure are the most crucial barriers to AV adoption. Industries should focus on the cause group barriers first as they run the system. By eliminating cause group barriers, the impact of effect barriers can be reduced. Implications and future directions were provided in the current study.

An Efficient and Robust Method for Data Privacy and Security on a Public Cloud Using a Novel Hybrid Technique,"The end user has a cost-effective and cloud-based method of storing and retrieving their personal information through remote access using some kind of network connectivity. The user may view the data at any time and from any location they want. However, the data that are stored on the cloud may not always stay in a safe state. As the data can only be accessed by the end user via the intervention of a third party, the authenticity and integrity of the data are at risk of being compromised. It is possible for many people to utilize different Web access at the same time to access and recover their information stored on the cloud. As a consequence, a user’s sensitive data are exposed, leaked, or lost in several locations. Cryptographic methods, such as the Elliptic Curve Cryptography, have been used in the development of a great deal of different algorithms and protocols, all with the intention of preserving the confidentiality and authenticity of the data (ECC). In this research, we present a safe and efficient method for exchanging data via the cloud, while simultaneously preserving both the data’s security and their integrity. The suggested system primarily operates by combining the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) technique with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) method to guarantee verification and maintain the solidarity of data. The findings of the experiments demonstrate that the strategy that was presented is effective and produces superior outcomes when compared to other ways that are already in use.

Efficient Deep Learning-Based Cyber-Attack Detection for Internet of Medical Things Devices,"The usage of IoT in the medical field, often referred to as IoMT, plays a vital role in facilitating the exchange of sensitive data among medical devices. This capability significantly contributes to enhancing the quality of patient care. However, it comes with privacy issues that compromise the security of the data collected by medical sensors, making them vulnerable to potential cyber threats such as data modification, replay attacks, etc. These attacks can lead to significant data loss or unauthorized alterations. Machine learning, particularly in cyber-attack detection systems, is crucial for identifying and classifying such attacks. Yet, the main challenge lies in adapting to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of malicious attacks and creating scalable solutions to combat them. The objective of this paper is to detect cybersecurity threats, with a particular focus on man-in-the-middle attacks that occur within the IoMT communication network. The study utilizes principal component analysis (PCA) for feature reduction and employs multi-layer perceptron to classify unforeseen cyber-attack IoT-based healthcare devices. The study evaluates the effectiveness of this proposed strategy using real-time data from the St. Louis Enhanced Healthcare Monitoring System (WUSTL-EHMS). The findings indicate that the multi-layer perceptron outperforms other tested classifiers, achieving an accuracy score of 96.39%, while also improving the performance by reducing the time complexity.

Numerical Analysis of Lid-Driven Cavity Flow Induced by Triangular Obstacles,"This research work presents a study on the flow behaviour in the lid-driven cavity (LDC) flows with triangular blocks using computational fluid dynamics techniques. The LDC flow is a widely studied problem that remains a standard for viscous incompressible fluid flows, with a range of parameters, including the Reynolds number, being explored. The finite volume method was used to discretize the domain, and simulations were computed using ANSYS FLUENT 2021 R1. The fluid flow started when the top wall is moved in the +X direction, whereas the other three walls are kept stationary. A grid independence test was performed to determine the optimum grid size and to obtain a grid-independent solution. Quantitative elements of the 2D flows in lid-driven cavities were explored for Reynolds numbers ranging from 1000 to 8000, and the results were validated against the existing literature. The consequence of different values of the Reynolds number (Re) were analyzed and examined through vorticity, streamline patterns, and kinetic energy contours. The velocity profile at the centerline was enhanced, and the vortex number and size increased with an increase in Re. The behaviour of the isolines of the vortices and the kinetic energy contours was also analyzed. The kinetic energy contours show that the high velocity of the fluid particles close to the upper wall is a significant factor affecting the maximum kinetic energy values. As the Reynolds number increased, the kinetic energy gradually increased at the boundary. This suggests that the Re considerably affects the energy values. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the flow behaviour of lid-driven cavities and the effects of obstacles on flow patterns, contributing to the existing literature and being useful for researchers and engineers working in the field of fluid dynamics.

A Hybrid MCDM-Grey Wolf Optimizer Approach for Multi-Objective Parametric Optimization of μ-EDM Process,"Micro-electrical discharge machining (μ-EDM) has come up as an effective material removal process for the manufacturing of miniaturized components in modern industries. The performance and quality of the μ-EDM process mainly depend on the combination of process parameters selected. This paper attempts to demonstrate the applicability of three well-known multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques, including the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC), and complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) methods, separately hybridized with the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. The proposed hybrid optimization approaches are applied to find the optimal parametric setting of a μ-EDM process during machining on a stainless steel shim as the work material. Feed rate, capacitance, and voltage were selected as the machining control parameters, while material removal rate, surface roughness, and tool wear ratio were selected as the responses. The polynomial regression (PR) meta-models are observed as the inputs to these hybrid optimizers. The results obtained are further compared to the traditional weighted sum multi-objective optimization (WSMO) approach, which suggests that all the considered MCDM-PR-GWO approaches outperform traditional PR-WSMO-GWO approaches in obtaining better machining performance measures.

Power-Yeoh: A Yeoh-Type Hyperelastic Model with Invariant I2 for Rubber-like Materials,"Rubber-based materials play an important role in various engineering and healthcare applications. Numerous hyperelastic models have been proposed in the long line of literature to model these nonlinear elastic materials. Due to the need to balance simplicity with accuracy, purely invariant I1-based models have been proposed, which possess certain limitations with respect to the accurate description of their mechanical behaviors. In this paper, we improve the Yeoh model, a classical and popular I1-based hyperelastic model with high versatility. The Yeoh model is modified by adding a generalized power-law type term. The model’s capabilities are analyzed under homogeneous deformation modes, such as uniaxial tensile, biaxial tensile and pure shear loading conditions. Experimental data pertaining to rubber-based materials are applied to the proposed hyperelastic model. Also, the interesting phenomenon of thin balloon expansion is investigated by applying the model to relevant experimental data on elastomeric balloons available in the literature. A genetic algorithm-based least squares optimization routine is carried out to determine the material constants while applying the reported experimental data. The results of curve fitting to experimental data pertaining to rubber-based materials showed the capability of the model to describe such multiaxial loading responses with acceptable accuracy (R2 ≥ 0.95). The model also showed the capability to describe both the limit-point instability and the strain stiffening in thin rubber balloons, demonstrating its versatility and suitability for modeling rubber-like materials under various applications. The model’s performance can be further extended in the future by coupling terms related to anisotropy, compressibility, damage, etc., according to requirements.

An Effective Network Intrusion Detection System Using Recursive Feature Elimination Technique,"Machine learning is an emerging area in research. Nowadays, researchers are utilizing machine learning across all domains to find optimal solutions. Machine learning facilitates the growth of an intrusion detection system (IDS) in the context of cyber security. These systems are proposed to identify and classify cyber-attacks on the network. However, an exhaustive assessment and performance evolution of various machine learning algorithms remains unavailable. In this study, we introduce a framework designed to nurture a versatile and efficient IDS adept at identifying and categorizing unexpected and evolving cyber threats. This is achieved through the use of Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). In RFE, the algorithm is run recursively until a selected number of features are identified to enhance efficiency and reduce computational cost. The rapid detection of these attacks can facilitate the identification of potential intruders, and the damage will be lowered. We attained remarkable accuracies, with an average rate between 98% and 99% across all the classifiers and against all four types of attacks. The random forest and decision tree models stood out, each achieving peak accuracies of 99% in both KDD-99 and NSL-KDD Datasets.

Estimation of Energy Storage Capability of the Parallel Plate Capacitor Filled with Distinct Dielectric Materials,"In the present work, the behavior of parallel plate capacitors filled with different dielectric materials and having varied gaps between the plates is developed and analyzed. The capacitor model’s capacitance and energy storage characteristics are estimated numerically and analytically. The simulation results of the model developed in the Multiphysics simulation package show that the capacitance of the capacitor decreases with an increase in the gap between the plates. Similarly, energy storage capacity increases with the material’s dielectric constant, with PVDF showing enhanced storage capacity. Further, the results of both analytical and numerical methods were in good agreement. Thus, the developed model was validated. The findings can potentially advance the design and optimization of capacitor-based systems, enabling the development of improved sensors, actuators, and efficient energy storage applications.

Image Processing Using Feature-Based Segmentation Techniques for the Analysis of Medical Images,"Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision in which an image is divided into many regions or segments, each of which corresponds to a separate object or part of an item within the image. Image segmentation’s major purpose is to simplify an image’s representation for analysis and interpretation, making it easier for a computer to comprehend and extract meaningful information from visual data. Adaptive K-means clustering is a variant of the classic K-means clustering algorithm in which the number of clusters (K) is continuously adjusted during the clustering process. Unlike classic K-means, which requires you to choose the number of clusters before executing the algorithm, adaptive K-means identifies the best number of clusters based on the features of the data. The proposed model works as follows. Firstly, pre-processing is performed by acquiring all the input images. Secondly, adaptive k-means clustering is employed for segmentation. Thirdly, important features are automatically extracted from X-ray images by making use of a feature-based image registration technique. Then, the detection of bone fractures is automatically carried out. The results are compared with those of existing studies, and it is observed that this model provides better results.

Integrating Pedagogical Approaches in the Study of Conic Sections Using Differential Equation and Analysis via Bayesian Inference,"In science and technology, the application of mathematics and mathematical modelling is crucial. A more conceptual and axiomatic approach has been taken in developing the narrative from geometry in the enormous history of mathematics. Mathematics is distinct from all other topics due to its use of theorems, proofs, axioms, corollaries, examples, results, and analysis. Applications of mathematics can be found, among others, in management sciences, biosciences, chemical technology, computer sciences, information technology, and the medical industry. Differentiation and its extensions are among the most frequently used branches in mathematics. Different curves are created when a plane connects with the surface of a cone. They are called conic sections. Conic sections have uses in physics and architecture, among other fields. In this study, differential equations are used to determine the conic section’s type and locate its center. The effectiveness of conventional and innovative teaching strategies is compared using Bayesian inference. The Bayesian method is employed to update the prior assumptions regarding the relative efficacy of the two approaches.

"The Thiadiazole Ring (THD) Is a Building Block for Potential Inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (Mpro): Theoretical Look into the Structure, Reactivity, and Binding Profile of Three 1,3,4-THD Derivatives toward Mpro","Thiadiazole (THD) derivatives are famous for their exceptional chemical properties and versatile biological activities. In this work, we report computational investigations of the structure, reactivity, and binding affinity of three 1,3,4-THD derivatives (THDs) toward the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Hirshfeld surface (HS) analyses are carried out in conjunction with topological calculations in the context of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and reduced density gradient (RDG) to unravel the nature and magnitude of noncovalent interactions that contribute to maintaining these THDs. The three approaches consistently indicate that the titled THDs are mainly stabilized by weak intramolecular H…H, C-H…π, C-H…N, and N-H..H interactions in their monomeric forms, while their dimers also exhibit intermolecular π…π stacking and T-shaped contacts. In addition, Hirshfeld atomic charges, frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), Fukui functions, and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) reveal that the pyrrolic H atom (ring F) and the imidazole N atom (ring E) are the preferred binding sites for nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks, respectively. Finally, docking and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the remarkable binding profile of THDs toward the Mpro, which can be related to potential inhibitory activity.

Hand Gesture Recognition in Indian Sign Language Using Deep Learning,"Sign languages are important for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities, as they provide a means of communication and expression. However, many people outside of the deaf community are not familiar with sign languages, which can lead to communication barriers and exclusion. Each country and culture have its own sign language, and some countries have multiple sign languages. Indian Sign Language (ISL) is a visual language used by the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in India. It is a complete language, with its own grammar and syntax, and is used to convey information through hand gestures, facial expressions, and body language. Over time, ISL has evolved into its own distinct language, with regional variations and dialects. Recognizing hand gestures in sign languages is a challenging task due to the high variability in hand shapes, movements, and orientations. ISL uses a combination of one-handed and two-handed gestures, which makes it fundamentally different from other common sign languages like American Sign Language (ASL). This paper aims to address the communication gap between specially abled (deaf) people who can only express themselves through the Indian sign language and those who do not understand it, thereby improving accessibility and communication for sign language users. This is achieved by using and implementing Convolutional Neural Networks on our self-made dataset. This is a necessary step, as none of the existing datasets fulfills the need for real-world images. We have achieved 0.0178 loss and 99% accuracy on our dataset.

Prediction of the Reaming Torque Using Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest Algorithm: Comparative Performance Analysis,"In any manufacturing setup, reaming operation is always prominent and present because of ever increasing demands for improved quality of the manufactured products. At the same time, new engineering materials make the process challenging. Further, reaming is the highly sought-after operation to achieve specified tolerance for specified applications to satisfy the rising demand for high-quality and precision-engineered products. Hence, accurate prediction of reaming torque is of utmost necessity, as it gives rise to uneven cutting forces, thereby affecting the surface finish of the reamed hole. High torque produces high-cutting forces, resulting in uneven surface finish and oversized holes. In this regard, the ability of traditional statistical tools to identify intricate correlations and patterns in reaming operation data is limited. To overcome these issues, machine learning methods such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) provide reliable options. The present study compares the use of ANN and Random Forest to analyze the data from reaming operations to predict the torque and compares it with those of the Random Forest method and the polynomial regression model. The model is trained and tested using a well-structured dataset that includes multiple input parameters (e.g., material, tool radius, and rotation angle) and the related reaming outputs (e.g., torque) in the suggested supervised learning method. An interconnected single layer of artificial neurons is used to create the ANN model. A comparison is made between the ANN and the Random Forest algorithm, a well-liked ensemble learning technique based on decision trees, to assess the performance of the ANN. The same dataset is used to train both ANN and Random Forest algorithms. The result showed that ANN gave better performance when compared to the other models, with testing accuracy of 94.4% and 61% for ANN and Random Forest, respectively.

A Novel DV-HOP and APIT Localization Algorithm with BAT-SA Algorithm,"Localization technology is essential for making wireless sensor networks(WSN)’s information processing and information collecting applications actually feasible. The beacon information is made available to the unknown nodes using the route exchange protocol. These data are more useful for determining the coordinates of neighboring nodes. Consequently, it was discovered that the algorithm for localizing nodes always has a flaw. Consequently, a brand-new metaheuristic termed Bat with simulated annealing is proposed to fix the flaw in the WSN standard node localization technique. The overall effectiveness of identifying the nodes is enhanced as a result of the large reduction in localization errors. The most popular localization estimation methods are the distance vector hop (DV-Hop) technique and approximate point-in-triangulation (APIT), which have high node localization accuracy and simple deployment in real-time environments. The primary benefits and their disadvantages, which give it a slight disadvantage in preference, are presented in this work. Both strategies are compared for their conventional performance and efficiency when combined with the Bat-SA algorithm.

A Comparative Experimental Performance Assessment of RTK+OSNMA-Based Positioning for Road Vehicle Applications,"To realize the societal need for greener, safer, and smarter mobility, ambitious technical challenges need to be addressed. With this aim, the H2020-EUSPA project ESRIUM investigates various aspects of highly accurate, reliable, and assured EGNSS localization information for road vehicles with a particular focus on automated vehicles. To analyze the achievable accuracy, reliability, and availability of multi-frequency and multi-GNSS mass-market receivers, we have conducted test drives under different GNSS reception conditions. In the tests, special focus was placed on using the Galileo Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA) service, offering an additional feature for assured PVT (position, velocity, and time) information with respect to spoofing. We analyzed the performance of three Septentrio Mosaic-X5 receivers operated with different OSNMA settings. It could be shown that strict use of OSNMA provides very good positioning accuracy as long as sufficient suitable satellites are available. However, the overall performance suffers from a reduced satellite number and is therefore limited. The performance of a receiver using authenticated Galileo with GPS signals (final status of Galileo OSNMA) is very good for a mass-market receiver: 92.55% of the solutions had a 2D position error below 20 cm during 8.5 h of driving through different environments.

Impact of Filler Electrodes on Welding Properties of Dissimilar Welded 316L/201 Austenitic Stainless Steels,"In this research, the gas tungsten arc welding method was used to join 201 and 316L austenitic stainless steels using various filler electrodes (316L, 309L and 309LMo), resulting in dissimilar welds, and its various properties, namely, microstructural evolution, mechanical behavior and corrosion behavior were investigated. The ferrite–austenite solidification mode was attained, and therefore, different types of ferrite (lathy ferrite and skeletal ferrite) were formed in the austenite matrix in all of the filler electrode weldments’ weld zones, however, the variation in content of ferrite was observed. A ferritoscope was used to estimate the ferrite content in the weld zone, and for E316L, E309L and E309LMo filler electrodes, the ferrite number observed were 8.78, 9.05 and 12.69 units, respectively. Hence, the 316L filler electrode exhibited the lowest ferrite content, while the 309LMo filler electrode weldment displayed a higher ferrite content ascribed to the variation in the chemical composition of filler electrodes (different chemical composition of ferrite stabilizer elements, namely, chromium, molybdenum, etc.). Further, the mechanical characteristics, including microhardness and tensile characteristics, were determined to be higher in the 309LMo filler electrode weldment, followed by the 309L and 316L filler electrode weldments, primarily due to the increased ferrite content. All the welds exhibited failure in the ductile mode. Moreover, higher sensitization was observed in the 309LMo filler electrode weldment, with the 309L and 316L filler electrode weldments following suit, which is ascribed to the higher ferrite content. This higher ferrite content resulted in higher interphase regions of ferrite/austenite, thus resulting in higher sensitization.

Novel and Optimized Efficient Transmission Using Dynamic Routing Technique for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks,"Underwater acoustic sensor networks involve deploying sensors underwater in order to establish a wireless network framework aimed at discovering new resources, detecting targets, and monitoring pollution. However, the primary challenge in these networks lies in enhancing energy efficiency and extending the sensor’s lifespan, as manually recharging batteries deep within the sea or ocean is not feasible. To address this, we have employed a dynamic network model for target sensing. In an effort to enhance the energy, transmission, and overall lifespan of the Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network (UASN), we have devised a Heuristic Search Algorithm called the Multi-population Harmony Search Algorithm. Additionally, a Dynamic Routing Technique has been developed to dynamically determine whether a given set of sensors should operate or enter sleep mode, with the objective of effectively covering the specified targets.

Experimental and Numerical Investigation on Damage Resistance Characteristics of Woven E-Glass/Epoxy Composite Laminates Subjected to Drop-Weight Impacts,"The utilization of composite materials in structural components has been on the rise in the aerospace, automotive, and marine industries. Although these materials offer numerous benefits, they can be damaged by various sources, such as low-velocity drop-weight impacts. Debris on a runway or tools falling onto composites can cause this type of impact, which has led to extensive research on crashworthiness and impact damage assessment. This study aimed to assess the response of woven E-glass/epoxy composite laminates under low-velocity drop-weight impacts. Tests were conducted using experimental methods and numerical simulations with a drop-weight impact-testing machine and the explicit finite element software LS-DYNA. The experimental tests were performed according to ASTM standards, with varied magnitudes of initial impact energy ranging from 7.85 J to 23.54 J and a specimen thickness of 4 mm. Force–time, energy–time, and force–displacement histories, obtained through the experiments and numerical analyses along with images of the damaged specimens, were examined. The effective stress contours are also illustrated to gain a deeper comprehension of the stress distribution in the laminates. The findings demonstrated that the impact energy significantly influences the impact response of the specimens, and both the experimental and numerical analyses yielded similar results, validating the modeling approach for the impact problem in composite materials. The study provides insight into the damage mechanism of woven E-glass/epoxy composite laminates under drop-weight impacts and is expected to contribute to a better understanding of their response in low-velocity drop-weight impact events.

Study of Different Properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) and Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO),"Graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are well known for their exceptional characteristics in a variety of applications. Reduced graphene oxide differs from graphene oxide in terms of morphological aspects, quality, functionalized groups, and crystallinities. Several attempts to synthesize GO and rGO have been documented in studies. The paper discussed the numerous ways to synthesize GO and rGO, and a literature review revealed that Hummers’ technique stands out as the most commonly used. Graphite is mixed with potassium permanganate, sodium nitrate, and strong sulfuric acid to make GO. Notably, Hummers’ technique has the advantage of faster synthesis and higher GO quality. The paper discusses several investigations, including the morphological and structural characteristics, chemical bonding information, and mechanical properties of GO and rGO. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and the Vickers Hardness Tester are generally used to study these characteristics. The FTIR analysis revealed that the most common peaks in both GO and rGO were found to be associated with the O-H, C=O, C-OH, and C-O functional groups. XRD examination, on the other hand, revealed a diffraction peak at 2θ = 10.2°, indicating oxidized graphite in the case of GO, as well as a graphitic peak at 2θ = 26.3°, indicating graphitic graphite. Furthermore, the addition of GO and rGO into ceramics or polymers was discovered to cause significant changes in their mechanical characteristics, such as tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and others. This demonstrates the revolutionary potential of graphene in improving the performance of composite materials.

Investigation of Elastic Properties of Sc Doped AlN: A First principles and Experimental Approach,"Aluminum Nitride (AlN) is a promising piezoelectric material for microelectromechanical systems owing to its attractive physical and chemical properties and CMOS compatibility. It has a moderate piezo response compared to its rival material bound to its wide application. This obstacle can be overcome by doping or alloying. Sc alloying increases the piezo response of AlN up to four-fold; it also increases the electromechanical coupling coefficient, which is a prominent figure of merit for any MEMS device application. Sc doping induces elastic softening in wurtzite AlN, enhances polarization, and increases piezoelectric constants. However, the possibility of phase separation at higher Sc concentrations, and the wurtzite phase of AlN, which is responsible for piezoelectricity, becomes negligible. Therefore, knowing the optimum concentration of Sc for device applications is necessary. In this work, using density functional theory, we calculated the lattice parameter, band and density of states along with the physical properties such as Young’s modulus, the bulk modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and elastic constants of pristine AlN and Sc doped AlN. The DFT calculations show that the geometrical optimized lattice parameters agree with the literature. As a function of increased Sc concentration, the calculated Young’s modulus and elastic constants decrease, indicating a decrease in hardness and elastic softening, respectively. Meanwhile, the bulk modulus and Poisson’s ratio increase with an increase in Sc concentration, representing an increase in the crystal cell parameters and elastic deformation. AlN and AlScN thin films were grown on Si (111) substrate using magnetron sputtering to study the structural properties experimentally. The deposited films show the required c-axis (002) preferential crystallographic orientation. The XRD peaks of Sc doped AlN thin films have shifted to a lower angle than pristine AlN, indicating elastic softening/tensile stress in grown thin films. So, from our observation, we can conclude that Sc doping induces elastic softening in AlN and deposited films have a preferential crystallographic orientation that can be applied in MEMS devices.

Research on the Integration of the Bamboo Charcoal Industry as a Sustainable Development Goal for Creating Value Chains in Local Revitalization: A Case Study of the Longci District,"In the past, research on regional revitalization has mainly focused on local culture and cultural industry. There is less research on the value composition of introducing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into local industries. Thus, we analyzed existing local characteristic industries and the composition of the industry value chain from a consumer perspective. The main observation factors were determined for the introduction of products with sustainable development, value creation networks, and the formation of a sixth industrial structure under SDGs. The value creation configuration of local industries was also analyzed. By applying the two-dimensional Kano model of quality, consumers’ attitudes towards products with SDG indicators were determined in local traditional industries more precisely. The correlation between the design of products with SDG indicators and satisfaction was also obtained. There was a two-dimensional correlation between the different qualities and satisfaction, rather than just a linear correlation. The research findings suggested that the value of the SDG indicators influenced consumers and societal trends significantly. Therefore, the value composition of the SDG indicators is the main determining factor for consumer expectations. The result provides a reference for stakeholders of local industries to construct a sustainable ecosystem in the regional revitalization system.

Preparation and Characterization of Activated Carbon Using Pinecone (Conifer Cone) to Remove Phenol from Wastewater,"Chemical industries are generating unprecedented effluent, including toxic aromatic compounds such as phenol, which poses severe environmental risks. This study explores the acute and prolonged effects of phenol, which range from the death of animals, birds, and fish to reduced plant growth, reproductive problems, and changes in appearance and behaviour. Additionally, oral exposure to phenol can be toxic to humans. Meanwhile, the agricultural sector faces challenges in finding salvage value for increasing amounts of waste. To address this issue, our research analyzes organic materials with no market value and investigates the feasibility of achieving efficient adsorption using their char. We specifically examine pine nuts, an abundantly available waste material. Our objective is to synthesize an organic adsorbent material that meets specific criteria: organic, readily available at zero cost, derived from waste with no other utility, native to the area, abundantly accessible, possessing a large surface area, and demonstrating superior adsorption capabilities. This research employs chemical activation using four acids (nitric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and orthophosphoric acid) and involves drying and heating the samples at different elevated temperatures. The selection of the optimal adsorbent is based on an analysis of the BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) surface area and pore volume, ensuring its efficacy. The adsorption efficiency was also tested with the help of a UV spectrophotometer to assess its efficiency using Beer–Lambert’s law. The study also goes through an ultimate analysis to measure the amount of carbon content in our adsorbent. Through this study, we aim to develop sustainable waste management practices by utilizing pine nut waste as a valuable resource for effective phenol removal.

The DFT calculations at zero temperature and pressure demonstrate that the stannite structure represents the ground state configuration of the Cu2ZnSnS4 system (with xGe = 0%), compared to the wurtzite-stannite structure. The calculations also show that the difference in enthalpies of formation (δH) between the stannite and wurtzite-stannite phases for CZTS is estimated to be 8.884 meV per atom. Regarding Cu2ZnGeS4, the wurtzite-stannite structure is found to be the most stable, closely followed by the stannite structure, with enthalpies of formation of −4.833 eV·atom−1 and −4.804 eV·atom−1, respectively. Notably, there are no definitive reports on enthalpy studies for the Cu2ZnGeS4 system in the existing literature. Understanding the behavior of these materials under different conditions can contribute to the development of improved performance and stability of devices based on CZTS and CZGS.

Feasibility Analysis of Tamura Features in the Identification of Machined Surface Images Using Machine Learning and Image Processing Techniques,"In modern manufacturing industries with Industry 4.0 capabilities, the automated identification and classification of machined surfaces based on their texture will play a crucial role. Texture analysis through computer vision, image processing, classification using artificial neural networks (ANN), and various machine learning techniques have been prominent research areas in recent decade. Tamura features are very popular in selecting optimum textural features from an image, especially in the medical domain. These textural features correspond to human visual perception and play a significant role in identifying and shortlisting the best features from the photographs. Despite the popularity of Tamura features in the medical domain, their usage in extracting the features from machined surface photographs is seldom reported. Hence, the present study investigates the feasibility of using Tamura features to classify machined surface images produced using turning, milling, grinding, and shaping operations in manufacturing. Photographs of the surfaces produced are obtained using smartphone cameras. Further, the photographs are preprocessed and divided into sixteen different portions. Then, Tamura features are extracted and are given as input to ANN, support vector machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF). The result shows that each machine learning (ML) algorithm performs differently while classifying the same set of machined surface images. Amongst the ML algorithms considered in the study, RF classified the photographs of surfaces machined using different machining operations with the highest accuracy. On the other hand, SVM performed poorly.

Characterization of Aluminium Alloy LM6 with B4C and Graphite Reinforced Hybrid Metal Matrix Composites,"Hybrid metal matrix composites (MMCs) are increasingly important in aviation, marine, automotive, and industrial manufacturing due to their ability to enhance the mechanical and chemical properties of composites. The study aimed to understand the fabrication, mechanical properties and microstructural properties of LM6/B4C/Gr composites. An aluminium alloy (LM6) is the base metal, having properties of less weight, medium strength, and excellent castability. The addition of B4C and Gr enhanced the tensile strength, hardness, and wear resistance of the composites, while maintaining good ductility. Boron carbide is a lightweight and extremely hard material with excellent wear resistance and high thermal stability. It has a specific modulus that is almost two times higher than that of aluminium, meaning it can provide superior stiffness and strength while maintaining a low weight such as drive shafts, housings, and structural supports. The addition of graphite improves the lubrication properties of the composites. Composites were successfully fabricated through a stir casting process, with the uniform dispersion of boron carbide and graphite particles in the aluminium LM6 matrix. The hybrid metal matrix composites are fabricated by five different combinations of B4C (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 wt%) with constant wt% of graphite (1 wt%).The fabricated samples of hybrid composites used to find the mechanical properties and microstructure analysis. The test results reveal that the tensile strength and hardness of the composites increased with an increase in the weight percentage of reinforcements, and the percentage of elongation decreases with increasing the reinforcement particles. The boron carbide (B4C) and graphite (Gr)particles in a matrix material are analyzed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) is used to evaluate the microstructure and chemical composition of the composites, providing valuable insights for their design and optimization.

Prediction of Machining Characteristics and Machining Performance for Grade 2 Titanium Material in a Wire Electric Discharge Machine Using Group Method of Data Handling and Artificial Neural Network,"The present research focuses on the machining of grade 2 titanium material using the Wire Electric Discharge Machining (WEDM) process by means of L16 Orthogonal Array (OA). This study investigates numerous process parameters, including pulse on time, current, pulse off time, voltage, bed speed and flush rate. The voltage and flush rate were kept constant throughout the experiment, while the other four parameters were varied for the machining process. In this study, a 0.18 mm molybdenum wire was utilized as the electrode material. Initially, this research aimed to optimize the process parameters to discern their impact on machining characteristics (Surface Roughness and Electrode Wear) as well as on machining performance (Acoustic Emission Signals). Subsequently, simpler functional relationship plots were generated between these parameters to recognize the potential information about the machining characteristics and machining performance. The straightforward approach lacks the capability to furnish information regarding the condition of the material (Surface Roughness), the tool (Electrode Wear) and the signals (Acoustic Emission). Hence, to estimate the experimental values the numerical tools viz., Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used. Upon comparing the predictive performance of ANN and GMDH, it became evident that the ANN’s predictions using 70% of the data for training displayed a higher correlation with the experimental values compared to the GMDH.

Comparison of Footrest Vibrations in the Case of an ICE-Based and Battery-Based Two-Wheeler,"The current work investigates the comfort of two-wheeler riders and compares the footrest vibration between an internal combustion-engine-based and electric two-wheeler. The Retrofit Hero Honda CD-100 two-wheeler is considered for the study and is further converted into the electric mode in the laboratory. Electric two-wheelers, even though they have fewer moving parts than internal combustion engine-based two-wheelers, encounter vibrations that emerge from road excitations. Cracks, potholes, and irregular humps on the road are the major influencers of these vibrations. These vibrations, when they transfer to the human body, have been reported to cause major injuries to the human body in the long run. By performing several trials on actual road conditions, with both the rider as well as pillion, the vibration dose value is calculated at the footrest. Different scenarios, such as a random speed test, a 20 kmph speed test and a 30 kmph speed test, are conducted on the two-wheeler. The vibration dose value (VDV) method is used to analyze the rider’s comfort. A comparison is made between the internal combustion engine-based and electric-based two-wheeler to determine its comfort level at the footrest. It is found that the VDV as well as the RMS acceleration decreased considerably in the case of the electric two-wheeler when compared to the internal combustion engine-based vehicle. However, it is found that as the speed is increased, the vibrations increased as well. Hence, further scope is found for the improvement and inculcation of vibration damping at the locations where the vibrations are pronounced in order to improve the overall riding experience of a two-wheeler rider.

Efficient Bloom Filter-Based Routing Protocol for Scalable Mobile Networks,"Non-geographic routing protocols are inefficient when applied to large-scale mobile networks composed of hundreds of nodes. On the other hand, geographic routing protocols have the disadvantage of needing a location sensor. The goal is to address the challenges of efficient content retrieval and routing scalability in NDN-based networks by leveraging the benefits of both NDN and Bloom Filter technologies. In this article we propose a routing protocol for mobile networks, which is scalable to networks composed of hundreds of nodes. The protocol does not require any localization equipment and is adapted for devices with limited memory and/or processing resources. This goal is achieved through the use of Bloom Filters to efficiently store and spread topological information. In the methodology followed, nodes do not forward messages with topological information to other nodes. To make the process efficient, each node aggregates the topological information it receives from its direct neighbors with its own and only the result of this operation is transmitted to the remaining nodes. Several simulations were carried out in the Qualnet network simulator in order to validate the algorithm proposed by the Hybrid Routing Algorithm with NDNs (HRAN). The obtained results were compared with other non-geographic protocols for mobile networks. HRAN seems to be a routing protocol designed for MANETs, utilizing Bloom Filters to manage topological information. A Bloom Filter is a data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set. It uses a bit array and multiple hash functions to determine if an element is present in the set. This type of data structure allows storing a large amount of binary information in an efficient way, reducing the resources required by the routing protocol.

Discount-Based Cloud Resource Management Using Cloud Broker,"Businesses require ways to check asset use in order not to disregard Service-Level Agreements and guarantee that assets are efficiently distributed to specific departments. A method of allocating, managing, and monitoring cloud resources is provided by cloud resource management systems. They permit one to make and oversee pools of assets, allocate those assets to explicit clients or applications, and track how they are being utilized. Users are able to request and provision resources as needed through a self-service interface provided by a good cloud resource management system. When using a cloud provider, businesses that manage their own resources frequently achieve greater efficiency. A portion of the ways in which IT robotization helps organizations deal with their assets involves setting boundaries for the greatest and least number of virtual machines (VMs), setting look-ahead times for VMs to appear, and halting VMs when they are inactive and, at that point, not needed for operations. Moreover, IT organizations might profit from developing a structure of warnings to further develop perceivability and control over asset utilization. Cloud computing is a model used to enable omnipresent, helpful, on-request network admittance to a common pool of configurable processing assets that can be quickly provisioned and delivered with negligible administrative exertion and without specialist organizations. Distributed computing is a financial model for huge corporations, as it removes the requirement for beginning interest in capital or framework costs.

For the most part, this implies that they presently use Software as a Service (SaaS) applications rather than authorized on-prem applications and that they have moved their restrictive programming and frameworks from a server farm to IaaS providers. For years, cloud experts have discussed whether there is truly such an amazing concept as a confidential cloud in IaaS, that is, an on-premises cloud in the client’s server farm. IaaS has undergone an extensive transformation from conventional equipment server farms to a virtualized and cloud-based framework. By eliminating the connection between equipment and working programs and middleware, companies found that they could scale data requirements rapidly and effectively to fulfill their responsibilities. To utilize IaaS, a business can buy a particular resource from a cloud computing supplier to reorganize its computing framework so clients can concentrate on tasks like acquiring and overseeing their own computer programs. This involves incorporating things like computer servers, applications for websites, and versatile gadgets. Along these lines, an enterprise can organize its own equipment infrastructure while having the required assets to carry out a plan of action.

Study on the Impact of Public Attention Relative to Green Development Policies on the Return on Investment of Related Industries,"As an emerging development model, green development requires the participation of the government, the market, and the public. It needs the formation of a positive interaction between policy guidance, market demand, and public will in order to realize a win–win situation comprising sustainable economic development and environmental protection. Thus, we explored green-development-related policies in China and defined four areas: industrial energy preservation, petrochemicals, agriculture, and the integration of the Yangtze River Economic Belt. Then, we analyzed how public attention relative to green development policies impacted the return of stock indices in the green industry using the Baidu search index. The research study was conducted on all trading days of A-shares in China from 1 January 2013 to 1 January 2023. In total, 2430 valid datasets were observed and curated over these 10 years. The public attention to green development policies was classified into four categories: industrial energy efficiency, petrochemicals, agriculture, and the Yangtze River Economic Zone. The attention focused on a category was measured by the number of searches of keywords that were the category’s names on the Baidu platform. The number of searches was considered the variable representing the public’s attention relative to each area of green development policies. The results showed that the increase in public attention to green development policies was not correlated with the increase in the return on investment (ROI) of green and carbon-neutral industries. In addition, information on green development policies had no significant effect on encouraging individuals to participate in investments in the green industry and had little effect on the financing of the carbon-neutral industry. The lack of details for green development policies and effective guidelines for potential investors needs to be overcome in order to encourage investment and financing.

Fault Detection and Classification in Electrical Power Transmission System Using Wavelet Transform,"A balanced operating power system with all elements carrying normal currents and bus voltages within the prescribed limits can be disrupted due to faults within the system. Overhead transmission networks are vulnerable to the vagaries of the atmosphere and, therefore, statistically have the highest probability of fault occurrence. Quick and accurate fault detections assist in timely remedial action, offering significant economic and operational benefits. Maintaining continuous and uninterrupted supply functionality is one of the critical objectives of electric utilities for a reliable system operation. Also, identifying and locating faults is crucial to address them in time to avert the risk of cascading failures. During faults, fast electromagnetic transients associated with the current and voltage waveforms can provide valuable insights into identifying abnormal operating conditions. To analyze these non-stationary signals in both the time and frequency domains, wavelet transform (WT) has become an indispensable tool. Thanks to its ability to adapt to variable window sizes, WT provides a more accurate and detailed resolution, making it a highly useful technique for signal analysis. In this context, this paper presents the application of WT-based intelligent technique to detect and classify power system faults accurately. The transient disturbances caused by various faults are subjected to wavelet transform analysis to analyze the detail coefficients of phase currents. The maximum detail coefficients of phase currents, which differ significantly when the system experiences a fault, served as the distinguishing feature to identify different power system faults. The phase current signals are analyzed with one of the wavelets from the Daubechies 4 (db4) family to obtain detail coefficients, thus enabling the categorization of the faults. Extensive simulation tests for fault types have been conducted on the standard IEEE 5-Bus system to demonstrate the technique’s effectiveness and fault detection capability, allowing utilities to take timely protective actions.

Helical Milling and Drilling for Hole-Making in CARALL: Experimental Evaluation,"Carbon fiber-reinforced aluminum laminates, known as CARALL, have wide applications in aircraft structures. However, numerous holes must be processed to assemble these structures, which is conventionally practiced through drilling. However, the drilling process exhibits certain limitations when utilized for hole-making in heterogeneous materials. In the recent past, helical milling has positioned itself as an alternative to the drilling process. However, helical milling performance examination during hole-making in CARALL is scant and needs further evaluation. The present study compares the milling process to the drilling process considering important performance indices, including cutting forces, surface roughness, chip morphology, machining temperature, and burr size. Additionally, microscopic characterization of the boreholes is performed to verify the presence of surface damage and delamination defects. Helical milling successfully lowered the thrust and radial forces and restrained the machining temperature below the levels attained via drilling. The diametrical deviation is higher at entry and lower at exit for both processes; however, helical milling produced holes with much higher accuracy. Helical milling developed smaller sized holes in comparison to drilling. Moreover, rougher surfaces due to the abrasion of continuous chips were observed in drilling, while a smoother finish was noted in helically milled holes. Based on the comprehensive comparative analysis, helical milling positions itself as an acceptable alternative to conventional drilling for machining fiber metal laminates.

This research aims to explore the current–voltage (I−V) characteristics of individual, series, and parallel configurations in crystalline silicon solar cells under varying temperatures. Additionally, the impact of different temperature conditions on the overall efficiency and Fill Factor of the solar cell was analyzed. With the aid of a solar simulator and required conditions, the I−V characteristics of each configuration—individual, series, and parallel—were obtained. The solar panel was subjected to various temperature settings, and I−V characteristics were obtained for each configuration to calculate the maximum power and Fill Factor for each case. In addition to this, the results showed that the parallel configuration has a larger power output, followed by the individual and series configurations. Additionally, the temperature of the solar panel had a significant effect on the output power of the solar cells. The maximum output power is also affected by temperature variation. The Fill Factor, on the other hand, was observed to be dependent on the configuration but had no significant variation with respect to the temperature. The effect of solar irradiance was also observed in a configuration with a definite temperature. This research offers valuable insights into the ideal configuration and optimal temperature for achieving maximum efficiency in crystalline silicon solar cells. Hence, a definite configuration with optimum temperature yields maximum power output and helps in attaining maximum efficiency.

The present study focuses on the enhancement of the effectiveness of a single-tube heat exchanger by attaching equilateral triangular-prism roughness elements on the peripheral heat transfer surface. The forced convection in a circular tube is analyzed using ANSYS-fluent considering air as the working fluid in the Reynolds number (Re) range of 10,000 to 18,000. The geometric parameters (the cross-section and the roughness element height) are fixed. The effects of longitudinal pitch, angular pitch and the orientation of triangular-prism roughness elements on the heat transfer and the frictional energy loss are studied. The presence of roughness elements on the heat transfer surface is found to increase turbulence and fluid mixing. Up to a 23% increase in heat transfer performance is seen in the Nusselt number values of the roughened tube over the smooth tube. The presence of roughness elements on the tube surface also increases the frictional losses; however, this increase is found to be gradual with the reduction in both longitudinal and angular pitch.

Key Generation in Cryptography Using Elliptic-Curve Cryptography and Genetic Algorithm,"Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) has become a robust cryptographic technique that ensures secure data transmission with comparatively small key sizes. In this context, this research introduces a novel approach to ECC-key-pair generation by utilizing genetic algorithms (GAs). GAs have proven effective in solving optimization problems by mimicking the principles of natural selection and genetics. The proposed genetic algorithm-based ECC-key generation process involves several stages: chromosome initialization, fitness evaluation, selection, uniform crossover, and mutation. Chromosomes representing points on an elliptic curve are initialized randomly, evaluated for their proximity to a predefined target point using a fitness function, and subjected to tournament selection to determine parents for the next generation. Uniform crossover and mutation operators then create offspring, inheriting traits from their parents while introducing diversity. The generated ECC-key pair comprises private and public keys derived from the GA-driven process. The private key is chosen randomly within the constraints of the elliptic curve’s parameters, while the public key is generated through the GA procedure. The study evaluates the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed ECC-GA approach through an empirical analysis of execution time, key size, and the size of the search space. The outcomes of this research highlight the potential of genetic algorithms in ECC-key generation, offering a promising alternative for enhancing the security and efficiency of cryptographic systems, especially in resource-limited environments. The exploration of key size and search space may assist in understanding the security implications and computational complexity associated with the proposed method. Overall, the ECC-GA approach opens avenues for further research in innovative key-generation techniques for modern cryptographic applications.

Containers are extensively used due to their lightweight and portable nature, allowing swift and agile deployment across different environments. However, the increasing popularity of containers has led to unique security risks, including vulnerabilities in container images, misconfigured containers, and insecure runtime environments. Containers are often built using public repository images and base image vulnerability is inherited by containers. Container images may contain outdated components or services, including system libraries and dependencies and known vulnerabilities from these components can be exploited. Images downloaded from untrusted sources may include malicious code that compromises other containers running in the same network or the host system. Base images may include unnecessary software or services that increase the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities. Several security measures have been implemented to address these risks, such as container image scanning, container orchestration security, and runtime security monitoring. Implementing a solid security policy and updating containers with the latest patches can significantly improve container security. Given the increasing adoption of containers, organizations must prioritize container security to protect their applications and data. This work presents automated, robust security techniques for continuous integration and continuous development pipelines, and the added overhead is empirically analyzed. Then, we nail down specific research and technological problems the DevSecOps community encounters and appropriate initial fixes.

A Design Optimization Methodology Applied to Conformal Cooling Channels in Injection Molds: 2D Transient Heat Transfer Analysis,"Fabricating conformal cooling channels has become easier and more cost-effective because of recent advances in additive manufacturing. Conformal cooling channels (CCCs) give better cooling performance than regular (straight drilled) channels during the injection molding process. The main reason for this is that CCCs may follow the paths of the molded shape, but regular channels cannot. CCCs can be used to decrease thermal stresses and warpage while also decreasing cycle time and producing a more uniform temperature distribution. Computer-aided engineering (CAE) simulations are crucial for establishing an effective and cost-effective design. This article focuses on the design optimization of an injection mold, with the goal of optimizing the location of cooling channels to reduce ejection time and increase temperature distribution uniformity. It may be inferred that the created technique is effective and appropriate for the objectives of this work.

Personal Social Network Profile Authentication through Image Steganography,"In the era of digital communication and social networking, the authenticity and integrity of personal social network profiles have become crucial for establishing trust and ensuring secure interactions. Existing methods often suffer from vulnerabilities like password theft, identity impersonation, and data breaches. To overcome these challenges, the paper introduces a new steganography method as a robust solution, leveraging the concept of hiding information within a seemingly innocent digital cover image. The proposed methodology involves imperceptible authentication and embedding profile information within a profile image or any other uploaded pictures in a profile’s timeline. This scheme is developed using a shell matrix, DNA encoding and absolute moment block truncation coding (AMBTC) compression. A shell matrix is used for concealing the private information and AMBTC compression is applied to compress large data files into smaller ones, which can speed up the network transmission of compressed code. By exploiting the redundancy in image data, the authentication data are embedded in a manner that is indistinguishable to human observers. To estimate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, wide experiments were conducted using real-world social network profiles. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed technique to successfully embed and extract authentication data while maintaining the profile photo’s visual appearance.

Research on Continuous Extrusion Method for Forming Thin-Walled Cup-Shaped Details,"Backward extrusion is a suitable method for forming thin-walled cup-shaped details. However, the deformation force is very large, making it difficult to choose equipment and ensure the durability of the die. The continuous extrusion method is improved from the traditional backward extrusion method to overcome the main disadvantages in the deformation process. The die structure in continuous extrusion is improved, including three main parts: fixed punch, primary punch, and die. The use of a smaller size original workpiece that is deformed in the fixed punch and flows into the die cavity is the cause of the significant reduction in the deformation force. The result obtained is that the deform of the workpiece is uniform and 200% larger according to the product height, and the deformation force is reduced by less than 50% compared to the traditional backward extrusion method. Therefore, continuous extrusion method is highly applicable in the production of products in industry and national defense.

Research on the Wearable Augmented Reality Seeking System for Rescue-Guidance in Buildings,"When a construction disaster occurs, the first-line rescue personnel often enter the disaster site immediately, and every second counts in rescuing the people who need help. However, the rescue personnel may not be familiar with the indoor layouts of different buildings. If the indoor paths are complicated, or when the fire smoke obstructs the line of sight, the rescue personnel are prone to spatial disorientation, which usually causes the rescue personnel to fall into danger. Therefore, we have developed the “Wearable Augmented reality Seeking System” (WASS) to assist rescue personnel in reading the information provided by the “Building Information Guiding System”. This system allows them to enter an unfamiliar space and reach the target rescue position, retreat to the entrance, or find an alternative escape route. The WASS is based on the HoloLens augmented reality system, which displays 3D digital information such as indoor layouts, one’s current location, spatial images captured by an infrared camera and a depth camera, and 3D virtual guiding symbols or text. The WASS includes two modules: First, the augmented reality gesture interaction module allows one to read the positioning anchor information of the “Building Information Guiding System” (BIGS). The rescue personnel can communicate via gestures, select the task target, and follow the 3D virtual guidance symbols in the air to reach the relay anchor points and finally arrive at the target position. Second, the service support module, including a lighting source and backup power, ensures that the QR code recognition process and long-term operation of the WASS are successful.

A Linear Differentiation Scheme for Camouflaged Target Detection using Convolution Neural Networks,"Camouflaged objects are masked within an existing image or video under similar patterns. This makes it tedious to detect target objects post classification. The pattern distributions are monotonous due to similar pixels and non-contrast regions. In this paper, a distribution-differentiated target detection scheme (DDTDS) is proposed for segregating and identifying camouflaged objects.

Convolutional neural learning is used for training the regions across pixel distribution and pattern formations. The neural network employs two layers for linear training and pattern differentiation. The differentiated region is trained for its positive rate in identifying the region around the target. Non-uniform patterns are used for training the second layer of the neural network. The proposed scheme pursues a recurrent iteration until the maximum segmentation is achieved. The metrics of positive rate, detection time, and false negatives are used for assessing the proposed scheme’s performance.

From the kinetics of Cd biosorption, it can be assumed that the Cd removal was a rapid process that achieved the concentration equilibrium of [Cd]biomass:[Cd]solution in the first minutes of the interaction. In individual experiments, the effect of solution pH, initial biosorbent, or Cd concentration was evaluated. According to MINEQL+ speciation modelling, it was found that the biosorption of Cd decreased linearly corresponding to a decrease in the proportion of Cd2+ in the solution. The biosorption data were well fitted to the Langmuir model of adsorption isotherm in comparison with the Freundlich model. The maximum biosorption capacity of the dried biomass of E. gracilis var. bacillaris for the removal of Cd was predicted and reached the value Qmax = 0.13 mmol/g or 14.1 mg/g (d.w.), respectively.

"Selecting a Suitable Flat in a High-Rise Apartment by Evaluation of Heat, Light, and Ventilation","In scientific literature, the impacts of heat, light, and ventilation on indoor settings have been extensively studied. It shows how important it is to consider a building’s HLV characteristics in the context of its surroundings. These elements have a direct impact on a building’s comfort level, energy effectiveness, and general sustainability. Many studies have investigated the effects of heat, light, and ventilation individually, rather than in combination with each other. This is because these factors have complex and dynamic interactions with each other, making it challenging to study them comprehensively. However, not many studies in this area have been made considering Indian geographical conditions. It can be challenging for a customer to find an apartment in a high rise building that meets their needs. Thus, using DesignBuilder tools at four different locations in India, a simulation was made and an analysis on the effects of HLV was performed for a symmetrical 10-storey building with adjacent buildings. An in-depth discussion of the air change rate of the building, daylighting performance in relation to different floors, and the difference between the indoor and outdoor temperatures of the building has been performed in this study. The criteria for choosing an apartment in a high rise building in accordance with the client’s requirements have also been derived from these results. Analysis on the effect of heat shows that the higher-density and taller surrounding buildings have a more pronounced effect on reducing the temperature difference. In the analysis of light, the height and distance of the surrounding buildings play a significant role in casting shadows on the main building. Ventilation analysis showed that higher floors have better ventilation compared to the lower floors and an increase in distance of the surrounding building increases the air change rate. The energy consumption analysis highlights that when the main building is surrounded by multiple buildings, energy consumption tends to decrease. The results indicate that as the building distance increases, energy consumption increases. Similar patterns are shown in all of the locations which were simulated, but the energy consumption load depends on the climatic condition of each location. Ahmedabad has the highest energy consumption load followed by Delhi, Guwahati, and Bangalore, irrespective of the distance and height of the surrounding buildings from the main building. Based on these findings, the guidelines were drawn for the selection of a suitable flat based on the requirement of the customer.

Sales-Based Models for Resource Management and Scheduling in Artificial Intelligence Systems,"Recent trends have shown a greatly increasing number of users in the digital world, so there is a need for a large number of resources. To handle these resources, there is the need to manage and schedule in an optimized manner using artificial intelligence (AI) systems. These systems deal with the business-common method of managing offerings. Ordinary models consolidate inbound deals, outbound bargains, account-based offerings, or a mix of diverse models. An organization model may gather multiple choices that an organization makes over a long period of time, considering a system, cycle, or trade. In our approach, computational resources are treated as commodities that can be bought and sold in a decentralized marketplace. Agents representing AI tasks or workloads participate in resource auctions, competing for the resources they need. The allocation of resources is determined through competitive bidding, where the highest bidder secures the required resources. This approach encourages efficient resource utilization and fair distribution based on the tasks’ priorities and value. Our sales-based models for resource management and scheduling offer a promising solution for optimizing AI systems’ resource allocation. By applying principles from auction theory and market dynamics, AI systems can become more adaptive, responsive, and efficient in managing computational resources, ultimately leading to improved performance and resource utilization.

Reducing Equipment Failure Risks by Redesigning of Products and Processes,"Low-voltage (LV) network assets, although they do not play a significant role in reliability indices compared to medium-voltage (MV) assets like the transformer and switchgears, are required to be designed in a way that would mitigate the risk of sporadic failures, hence incurring an R&M cost. LV assets like LV cables, distribution panels, molded-case circuit breakers (MCCBs), and miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) generally do not have a planned maintenance (PM) schedule and are procured based on the run-to-failure concept in view of the huge volume. These assets are exposed to the harshest of environmental and operation conditions. Hence, it is imperative that we take the necessary measures during the design stage such that they are able to cater to their stringent duties, which include frequent short circuits, exposure to the environment, and thermal overloads. It is also important to periodically review the product design based on site feedback and product performance to re-calibrate the product and its associated processes. Through this technical paper, several case studies are presented wherein special terminal connectors with shear bolts were designed to mitigate the thermal hotspot issues causing frequent fire and failures—i.e., vertical fuse switch disconnectors (VFSDs) and miniature circuit breaker (MCBs). A case study on condition monitoring through a substation inspection schedule is also presented, through which potential failures were averted in time. The observations and measurements are mapped in an SAP system for trend analysis. With the adoption of effective product and process design, AEML has reduced asset failures.

Natural Compound Honokiol and Its Application against Fulvestrant-Resistant Breast Cancer Cells: An In Vitro Challenge,"The history of the use of natural compounds as therapeutic agents goes back many centuries. Being the first objects of interest in the early days of medicine, natural compounds are still of great relevance, considering the improvement of methods for isolation, chemical transformation, and synthesis. They are also used in oncology, with the advantage of preventing the development of toxicity to normal cells and resistance in tumor cells. One of the promising classes of natural compounds with antitumor activity is lignans. We studied a number of lignans (arctiin, honokiol, matairesinol, pinoresinol, myrislignan, enterodiol, and enterolactone) in the breast cancer cell line MCF7 and the subline MCF7/FUL with acquired resistance to the antiestrogen fulvestrant. Antiproliferative activity was assessed using the MTT test. An analysis of the level of intracellular proteins was carried out via immunoblotting. Based on the results of the screening, the most active compound was honokiol; it had the lowest IC50 value for both MCF7 and MCF7/FUL cells, 19.7 μM and 9.1 μM, respectively. The revealed antiproliferative activity of honokiol against resistant cells prompted us to study its effects on intracellular proteins associated with proliferation and cell death. Honokiol suppressed the expression of Bcl-2 (an inhibitor of apoptosis) and cyclin D1 (a cell cycle regulator) in both cell lines, but this effect was more pronounced in the resistant subline. The decrease in the expression of antiapoptotic and proliferative proteins induced by honokiol is consistent with its antiproliferative effect, which is more pronounced in resistant subline MCF7/FUL.

Enhancing Skin Disease Segmentation with Weighted Ensemble Region-Based Convolutional Network,"Skin diseases are a prevalent and diverse group of medical conditions that affect a significant portion of the global population. One critical drawback includes difficulty in accurately diagnosing certain skin conditions, as many diseases can share similar symptoms or appearances. In this paper, we propose a Weighted Ensemble Region-based Convolutional Network (WERCNN) methodology that consolidates a Mask R-CNN (Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) with the weighted average ensemble technique to enhance the performance of segmentation tasks. A skin disease image dataset obtained from kaggle is utilized to segment the skin disease image. This study investigates the utilization of a Mask R-CNN in skin disease segmentation, where it is prepared on a skin disease image dataset of dermatological pictures. The weighted average ensemble model is utilized to optimize the weights of the Mask R-CNN model. The performance metrics accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score are to be employed; this can achieve the values of 94.7%, 93.6%, 93.9%, 92.6%, and 93.7%, respectively. With regard to skin disease segmentation, the WERCNN has shown extraordinary in accurately segmenting the impacted regions of skin images by providing valuable insights to dermatologists for diagnosis and treatment planning.

Leaky ReLU-ResNet for Plant Leaf Disease Detection: A Deep Learning Approach,"Plant diseases can result in significant yield losses, posing a threat to food security and economic stability. Deep neural networks, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown exceptional success in image classification tasks, often surpassing human-level performance. However, conventional methods for leaf disease detection relied on manual inspection by agricultural experts, leading to limited scalability and precision. To tackle these challenges, this research introduces a novel approach called the Leaky Rectilinear Residual Network (LRRN) for plant leaf disease detection. The LRRN model comprises three key modules—data pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. It integrates ResNet architecture with the Leaky ReLU activation function to classify plant diseases. Experimental evaluations were performed on affected plant leaf disease images from the Plant Village dataset, utilizing performance evaluation metrics to assess the proposed model. The achieved results were compared to state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating superior accuracy (94.56%), precision (93.48%), F1-scores (92.83%), recall (93.12%), and specificity (92.58%). These findings substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed LRRN method of plant leaf disease detection.

Identification of Turmeric Rhizomes Using Image Processing and Machine Learning,"India is the world’s leading producer and exporter of turmeric. Indian turmeric is known as the best in the world because of its natural medicinal properties. Different turmeric varieties have different amounts of nutritional value, which results in variations in their cost and quality. The quality assessment of turmeric aids in evaluating and determining its quality, and it helps to promote its marketing. Hence, the identification of turmeric cultivars is of great importance. But it requires manual inspection by human experts, generates subjective results and is time-consuming. Machine vision will provide a more accurate and faster way to identify different agricultural products and their varieties. This study presents an automated system to identify turmeric rhizome varieties by extracting morphological, color and texture features. The classification of different rhizome types is carried out by using image processing techniques followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifiers. The proposed work shows promising results for the identification of turmeric rhizome varieties.

A Photovoltaic (PV)-Wind Hybrid Energy System Using an Improved Deep Neural Network (IDNN)-Based Voltage Source Controller for a Microgrid Environment,"Presently, there has been a huge rise in the demand for power owing to increases in population and commercial organizations. Traditional power plants are not able to keep up with the increasing needs of customers. Finding a different way to meet consumers’ needs is the main problem in the current situation. Most RESs (renewable energy sources) like wind, solar, hydro/water sources and fuel cells are environmentally beneficial. The number of available resources has no bearing on how much electricity can be produced using RESs. Due to differences in natural resources, there are constant fluctuations in the availability of RESs. In this technical study, two significant RE (Renewable Energy) power sources—PV (photovoltaic) cells and WES (wind energy systems)—are studied in various weather scenarios. First, a cutting-edge intelligent controller system was created, which aids in tracking the peak power point. Due to the unpredictable nature of weather, a MPPT (maximum power point tracking) controller is required for RES. This work aims to present IDNN- (improved deep neural network) and MPPT-based unique methods for power generation using solar and winds. When a hybrid PV/WES system is integrated into MG s(microgrids), power quality may be improved and THD values can be reduced. It was confirmed from the results of the simulation that the proposed IDNN system yields better performance in different operating situations by means of lower MSE (mean square error) rates, lower THD (total harmonic distortion) and lower computational complexity than the existing method.

Automated Route Planning from LiDAR Point Clouds for Agricultural Applications,"This paper develops an algorithm to compute optimal routes for an autonomous compost turner. In commercial composting, the material to be composted is piled up in large heaps called windrows and turned regularly by compost turners. The environment at the composting site is constantly changing, as the locations of the windrows change with each turning procedure. Therefore, we propose a novel method that automatically computes routes on a composting plant from LiDAR data. The LiDAR is mounted on the compost turner together with a dual-antenna GNSS receiver, an IMU, and rotary encoders. An extended Kalman filter is used to obtain the vehicle’s pose. Through direct georeferencing, a global point cloud is obtained. The routing algorithm crops, segments, and filters the point cloud until the points along the ridge of each windrow remain. These points are used to compute the optimal routes along each windrow. Furthermore, a user can select the windrows which need to be turned and the algorithm then computes the most efficient path for the compost turner, which also includes the passages between the windrows. The method was tested within a simulation environment using a 3D model of the composting site. The results show that the algorithm detects the windrows and computes the routes with sufficient accuracy for autonomous compost turning.

Human Emotion Detection Using DeepFace and Artificial Intelligence,"An emerging topic that has the potential to enhance user experience, reduce crime, and target advertising is human emotion recognition, utilizing DeepFace and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The same feeling may be expressed differently by many individuals. Accurately identifying emotions can be challenging, in light of this. It helps to understand an emotion’s significance by looking at the context in which it is presented. Depending on the application, one must decide which AI technology to employ for detecting human emotions. Because of things like lighting and occlusion, using it in real-world situations can be difficult. Not every human emotion can be accurately detected by technology. Human–machine interaction technology is becoming more popular, and machines must comprehend human movements and expressions. When a machine recognizes human emotions, it gains a greater understanding of human behavior and increases the effectiveness of work. Text, audio, linguistic, and facial movements may all convey emotions. Facial expressions are important in determining a person’s emotions. There has been little research undertaken on the topic of real-time emotion identification, utilizing face photos and emotions. Using an Artificial Intelligence-based DeepFace approach, the proposed method recognizes real-time feelings from facial images and live emotions of persons. The proposed module extracts the facial features from an active shape DeepFace model by identifying 26 facial points to recognize human emotions. This approach recognizes the emotions of frustration, dissatisfaction, happiness, neutrality, and wonder. The proposed technology is unique, in that it implements emotion identification in real-time, with an average accuracy of 94% acquired from actual human emotions.

Using Chemical Precipitation to Recover Struvite from Household Wastewater for Agricultural Fertilizer Utilization,"Struvite is a substance that can be extracted from wastewater and has the potential to replace conventionally manufactured fertilizers and reduce environmental issues. A slow-release fertilizer can more effectively be used by matching the nutrient requirements of plants through the growing period and gradually supplying N and P for crop growth. Struvite is an ecologically friendly fertilizer because of its gradual fertilizer treatment and high quality. Existing research indicates that the solubility and absorption of struvite by plants are equivalent to those of artificial phosphorus fertilizers such as triple superphosphate or potassium phosphate. Struvite is recognized to be an effective fertilizer for grass, tree seedlings, ornamental plants, vegetables, and flower beds. Struvite precipitation removes phosphorus and nitrogen from sewage water, hence alleviating phosphorus shortages from non-renewable phosphorus sources and water eutrophication. Struvite would also be useful in the grasslands and woods where fertilizers are used. However, the agricultural utility of struvite has not been thoroughly investigated. As a result, this work is reported as a pot experiment designed to assess the fertilizer value of struvite. Experimental settings were created, and pot experiments were conducted to establish the optimal amount of struvite based on two factors. The initial pH for struvite synthesis was 9. The formulated struvite fertilizers were compared to standard phosphorus fertilizers in the pot trials. Fourier-transform spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy-Dispersive X Ray Spectroscopy (EDAX) were employed to support the quantitative findings. To summarize, struvite precipitation is a desirable and effective method for removing phosphate and nitrogen from domestic sewage water and using them as fertilizers.

A Hybrid Modified Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)-Based Artificial Neural Network Model for Power Management Controller and Hybrid Energy System for Energy Source Integration,"Small MGS (microgrid systems) are capable of decreasing energy losses. Long-distance power transmission lines are constructed by integrating distributed power sources with energy storage subsystems, which is the current trend in the development of RES (renewable energy sources). Although energies produced by RES do not cause pollution, they are stochastic and hence challenging to manage. This disadvantage makes high penetration of RES risky for the stability, dependability, and power quality of main electrical grids. The energies obtained from RES must thus be integrated in the best possible way. To provide maximum energy sustainability and best energy usage, hybrid energy systems must manage energy efficiently. In order to improve power management and make better use of RES, this study offers a hybrid energy power management controller based on hybrid MABC (modified artificial bee colony) and ANN (artificial neural network) for MGS, PVS (photovoltaic system), and WT (wind turbine). Controlling power flows between grids and energy sources is the suggested approach for power control. D/R (demands/responses), customer reactions, offering priorities, D/R properties like COE (cost of energies), and sizes (lengths) are considered in this work. Along with current techniques, a suggested model is implemented in the MATLAB/Simulink platform.

"Effect of Lanthanum Doping on the Structural, Morphological, and Optical Properties of Spray-Coated ZnO Thin Films","In recent years, transparent conducting oxide semiconductor materials have found applications in both science and technology, especially in the areas of semiconductors, optoelectronics, and a wide range of energy efficiency devices. These TCO materials are the building blocks of various optoelectronic devices, such as transparent thin-film transistors, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes. This work concentrates on the structure, morphology, and optical properties of ZnO and Zn0.95La0.05O thin films at 673 K using a chemical spray technique. The polycrystalline nature and wurtzite structure of ZnO were confirmed by using XRD analysis with preferred growth along the (1 0 1) plane. The Zn0.95La0.05O deposits showed maximum crystallinity of 15.4 nm and a strain value of 2.4 × 10−3. The lattice constants increased for lanthanum-doped ZnO thin films due to the ionic radii mismatch of the doping material, which causes lattice expansion. Fibrous morphology was observed for ZnO, and a mixed structure of grains and fibers was observed for Zn0.95La0.05O films, which confirms the insertion of La3+ into the Zn2+ position. The Zn0.95La0.05O deposits showed transmittance above 80% due to the increased crystalline quality and a bandgap of 3.32 eV. The photoluminescence spectra showed peaks corresponding to e-h recombination, zinc defects (Zni and Ozn), and oxygen vacancy (Oi and Vo). The lanthanum-doped ZnO films showed increased band-edge emission and decreased defect-related peaks due to the increased crystalline quality. Hence, the doping of La3+ ions into a ZnO lattice enhances the crystalline quality and increases the transparency of the host ZnO matrix, which is suitable for optoelectric device applications.

A Secure Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithm for the Internet of Things (IoT) Based on Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) Sequences,"The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) across various domains has ushered numerous applications into our daily lives. Ensuring the security of sensitive data, including wirelessly transmitted private information and images generated by IoT devices is paramount. However, IoT devices are often termed “constraint devices” due to their limited computational resources like CPU power or memory capacity. Also, ensuring the integrity of IoT devices and networks is imperative in fostering trust in the capabilities and benefits of IoT technology. Addressing data tampering, device vulnerabilities, and network weaknesses through proactive security measures is essential in realizing the full potential of the IoT while safeguarding against potential risks and disruptions. Traditional encryption approaches prove inadequate, as they demand excessive computational power; this is a challenge for IoT devices. To address this, a novel and less intrusive encryption method has been proposed, leveraging the inherent unpredictability of DNA nucleotide sequences. This approach is tailored to accommodate the resource constraints of IoT devices. By harnessing the intrinsic randomness of DNA sequences, a robust secret key is generated, significantly bolstering resilience against attackers. The key is crafted through uncomplicated substitution techniques and transposition operations. Upon satisfying the computational requisites of IoT devices and safeguarding image security, a DNA-based key comes into play for photo encryption. Rigorous testing has demonstrated its effectiveness, showcasing its superior attributes in terms of key size, encryption speed, and distortion minimization when compared to alternative encryption techniques. This innovative encryption paradigm not only upholds the integrity of IoT-generated data but does so without overwhelming the devices’ limited computing capabilities.

Design of a Prediction Model to Predict Students’ Performance Using Educational Data Mining and Machine Learning,"The development of a knowledge- and information-based society can be aided by higher education. Through research and extension efforts, higher education institutions must perform a variety of functions, including building an intelligent human resource pool, gaining new skills, and creating new knowledge. As a result, the development of skilled workers with the ability to think critically, creatively, and logically is the primary focus of higher education institutions. However, there are some significant obstacles in the way of offering quality education, such as how to identify low-performing students and their causes. Predicting student performance has become challenging as a result of the vast quantity of data in educational databases. The lack of a developed system for assessing and monitoring student achievement is also not being considered. There are primarily two causes for this kind of situation. Initially, there was inadequate study of the various prediction techniques to select the ones that would best predict students’ success in educational environments. The second is the lack of investigation into the courses. In this research work, efforts have been made to identify low-performing students through the proposed Back Propagation Neural Network for Student Performance Analysis (BPNN-SPA) model, which generates more accurate, efficient, and dependable results as compared to some of the existing techniques and models. The performance of the proposed model is compared with the Support Vector Machine and Random Decision algorithms and evaluated by four significant performance metrics, namely, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the F-measure. Based on performance measures, the proposed BPNN-SPA achieved better accuracy than existing algorithms.

Insights and Implications: Unraveling Critical Factors in Resistance Spot Welding of Dissimilar Metals through SS 347 and DSS 2205 Welds,"This research focuses on analyzing the microstructural and mechanical characteristics of SS 347 and DSS 2205 stainless steel dissimilar welds. This is achieved by altering the weld parameters, welding current and heating cycle at three different levels each. In total, nine experimental trials were conducted and the welded sheets were applied to macrograph studies and a tensile shear test for analyzing the nugget quality and mechanical strength. The welded specimens were placed for observation under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to observe the microstructure of the weldments. Specimen 9 was subjected to a microhardness test. The macrograph study revealed that the nugget size grows proportionally to the rise in the welding current and heating cycle. When the current exceeds 7.5 kA, the size of the nugget exceeds the threshold value of 4√t, where ‘t’ is the sheet metal thickness. The tensile shear test results clearly indicate that as the nugget size grows, the tensile force also rises. Sample 9 possesses a maximum tensile force of 18 kN and the mode of failure observed is influenced by the welding current and heating cycles. The failure mode of sample 9 was pulled out and the microhardness was maximum at the fusion zone with 320 HV.

Effect of Fly Ash on Geotechnical Properties of Soft Soil: A Critical Review,"An industrial by-product known as fly ash is produced when coal is burned for electricity production and is considered an environmental pollutant. A comprehensive fly ash utilisation programme must be implemented to reduce environmental pollution, including numerous factors at different levels. Fly ash’s geotechnical qualities, including its specific gravity, permeability, internal angular friction, and consolidation characteristics, make it ideal for structural fill, particularly on clay soils, when building highways and embankments. Much research has been conducted on how fly ash affects soil stability. In order to determine the impact of fly ash addition on soil properties, this inquiry reviewed a few of these papers and conducted a critical assessment. This study also looked at combining fly ash and clay soil. Numerous investigations indicate that fly ash generally improves soil stability, notably when analysing CBR values and soil permeability, and reduces volumetric changes in the soil. The ground becomes compact due to particle size and form and a decrease in volumetric dilatation.

Firefly Optimized Resource Control and Routing Stability in MANET,"A mobile adhoc network (MANET) is a network that comprises mobile devices positioned in various places functioning without any central administration. Routing in MANET plays a vital role when the data packet (DP) is sent from source to destination. In order to improve the routing stability in MANET, resource utilization (i.e., energy and bandwidth) has to be controlled. An effective firefly resource-optimized routing (FFROR) technique controls resource utilization and improves routing stability during data packet (DP) transmission in MANET. Initially, in FFROR, the firefly resource optimization (FFRO) algorithm generates the population of fireflies (i.e., mobile nodes). It calculates the light intensity of every firefly based on objective functions (i.e., minimum energy consumption and minimum bandwidth utilization). The FFRO algorithm ranks fireflies according to the light intensity and finds the best resource-optimized mobile node (MN) to send the DP to the destination. This, in turn, helps in finding the resource-optimized mobile nodes and choosing the route path for sending the DP to the destination. The proposed FFROR technique uses the FFRO algorithm to increase routing stability and throughput. The simulation is carried out to analyze the performance of proposed FFROR techniques with parameters such as energy consumption, bandwidth availability, routing stability, and throughput.

Research on Rescue Guiding Mechanism in Buildings: Illustrated by the Building Information Guiding System,"When disasters such as fires or earthquakes occur, rescue personnel entering buildings are prone to spatial disorientation when the buildings have complex indoor compartments or compartments with high uniformity and similarity. This situation may expose both the people waiting for help and the rescue personnel to dangerous conditions. Therefore, this research study proposes that government search and rescue units can pre-establish a database of indoor spatial information for buildings. When a disaster occurs, the spatial information needed by rescue personnel can be transmitted in real-time and displayed on wearable 3D display systems. Given this proposal, we have developed a “Building Information Guiding System” (BIGS) to provide spatial information in real-time through the “Wearable Augmented-reality Seeking System” (WASS). BIGS uses QR codes presented at different information anchors in a building to display various embedded spatial information on horizontal and vertical escape paths, the locations of exits, firefighting equipment, and electrical power generator sets. According to the information provided by BIGS, 3D virtual arrows can be displayed in the air by the HoloLens augmented reality helmet worn by the rescue personnel in order to guide the direction toward the target. The BIGS system can read the Building Information Modeling (BIM) file submitted with new construction projects to the government construction management units and then input necessary spatial information to the file to establish an exclusive 3D spatial database for that new construction. BIGS can also construct an entire 3D spatial database for an old building by reading the BIM 3D point cloud model created through 3D laser scanning. This study explores the feasibility of using the BIM model to construct the BIGS system, the presentation mechanism of serial QR codes in real space, and the steps and modes of inputting spatial information into the 3D spatial database.

Supervised Sentiment Analysis of Indirect Qualitative Student Feedback for Unbiased Opinion Mining,"In the education domain, the significance of student feedback and other stakeholders for raising educational standards has received more attention in recent years. As a result, numerous instruments and strategies for obtaining student input and assessing faculty performance, as well as other facets of education, have been developed. There are two main methods to collect feedback from students, as follows: the direct and indirect methods. In the direct method, feedback is collected by distributing a questionnaire and taking their responses. The limitation of this method is that the true experience of students is not revealed, and there is room for bias in the collection and assessment of such a questionnaire. To overcome this limitation, the indirect method can be followed where social media posts can be used to collect feedback from students as they are active on social media and use it to express their opinions as posts. To address the problem of the manual annotation of large volumes of data, this paper proposes a machine learning method that uses the sentiment 140 dataset as the training set to automate the process of annotations of tweets. The same method can be used to label any qualitative data. In total, 5000 tweets were scraped and considered for this study. Various pre-processing methods, including byte-order-mark removal, hashtag removal, stop word removal, and tokenization, were applied to the data. The term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) trigrams technique was then used to process the cleaned data. The TF-IDF technique using trigrams captures negation for sentiment analysis. The vectorized data are then processed using various machine learning algorithms to classify the polarity of tweets. Performance parameters such as the F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision are compared. With a 94.16% F1-score, 94% precision, 94% recall, and 95.16% accuracy, the Ridge Classifier performed better than the others.

A Methodical Review of Iridology-Based Computer-Aided Organ Status Assessment Techniques,"The pseudoscience known as iridology makes the unsubstantiated claim that it can identify medical disorders by examining the iris, the colored portion of the eye. Iridology does not provide a reliable means of diagnosis, and there is no scientific proof to back up its claims. To find patterns that are connected to particular medical conditions, computerized iris analysis software may need to examine thousands of iris images. A method of iridology known as Computer-Aided Iridology (CAI) uses software to study the iris. CAI still is not a medically accepted diagnostic technique and is not any more trustworthy than conventional iridology. Applying technology in medical science had a great impact on diagnosing diseases. Decision making is the most critical task in computer-aided applications. Computer vision and deep learning make this task more accurate and are widely used in many applications, mainly in diagnosing diseases. The methodologies, data acquisition source, and volume of data used for both training and testing in the pre-diagnosis of human organs utilizing iris patterns are thoroughly studied. Understanding its limitations allows researchers to concentrate on creating and evaluating improvements in technology that could boost its accuracy and usefulness. Iridology has been considered as having no use for years and becomes effective when combined with technology. This study includes various technical factors used in iridology for the pre-diagnosing of diseases. Recognizing the limitations of iridology allows healthcare providers to avoid errors in diagnosis and prevent individuals from undergoing redundant procedures or therapies based solely on iridology assessments.

Biodegradability of Musa Acuminata (Banana)-Fiber-Reinforced Bio-Based Epoxy Composites: The Influence of Montmorillonite Clay,"The increasing environmental concerns associated with conventional composites, made using glass-fiber-reinforced polymers (GFRP) and carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP), have shifted attention to bio-based composites. These environmentally responsible alternatives offer performance without sacrificing biodegradability. The present study examines the biodegradability of a novel bio-based epoxy composite reinforced with Musa acuminata (banana) fibers. Two composite variants were compared: one with 2.5% Montmorillonite (MMT) nanoclay and one without. While previous research has demonstrated an enhancement in mechanical and physical properties of polymer matrix composites with the addition of MMT nanoclay, it was hypothesized in this study that nanoclay addition would not significantly impact the composites’ biodegradability. To confirm this, we conducted standard biodegradability tests and an SEM analysis. The SEM results revealed a uniform distribution of MMT nanoclay within the bio-based polymer matrix, in addition to strong interfacial adhesion and decreased void crater sizes. The inclusion of nanoclay did not significantly impact the composites’ biodegradability, according to the statistical analysis provided in the present study. The present study also developed regression models to predict biodegradability over time to facilitate the determination of the timespan required for 100 percent biodegradability of the tested bio-based composite. Thus, this study is a significant benchmark for advancing eco-friendly composite materials.

Determination of the Fracture Point for Inconel-718 Using Luder’s Band Method,"The current scenario demands the usage of alternate materials with lower stress and stress–strain energy deformation for applications in gas turbines, chassis of automobiles, and biomedical instruments. The work on Inconel-718 can be carried out as it is a new material; it can be used for many applications in addition to its usage in automobiles. Inconel-718 is a superalloy of nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr). Inconel-718 is corrosion resistant and oxidation resistant when subjected to extreme temperature conditions. But when applying tensile and compressive load, it bends, causing the formation of Luder’s band. The work analyses the formation of Luder’s band in Inconel-718. The methodology for detecting Luder’s band is based on the material structure. It also depends on the material’s rigidity modulus and the shear stress ratio to shear strain. The stress, harmonic, and thermal analyses were carried out using ANSYS to find the red-hot zone for the formation of Luder’s band. The results demonstrate that Luder’s band is mainly formed at the middle point of the frame. The stress for Inconel-718 is in the range of 0.064454 MPa to 81.514 MPa, whereas the frequency varies from 0.71157 to 475.87 Hz under vibration load. Conversely, while heating Inconel-718, the temperature varies from 1.6009 × 105 to 112.83 °C. The analysis shows that Inconel-718 is a better material for designing automobile parts.

LS-Dyna Impact Modelling on Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) Composite Aircraft Panel with Various Impactors,"In the aviation industry, the usage of composites is increasing because of their unique feature in terms of damage tolerance and high structural integrity. It inspires the researcher to focus on dynamic behaviour of subsonic aircraft hat-shaped CFRP composite panels using the LS-Dyna tool to prove its excellent impact behaviour with the help of spherical, ogival and conical impactors. High-velocity impact simulations conducted in this research work duplicate the Foreign Object Damage on aircraft panels. The impact load locations are identified from the literature and notable damage features such as stresses, delamination length, internal energy absorbed, resultant force, delamination zone, resultant acceleration and resultant velocity are compared for the chosen impactor shapes. The elastic and plastic failure zones are displayed very clearly in the results to avoid any further damage in the future. All results help to understand the composite shell behaviour and different damage patterns.

A Model of Gamification by Combining and Motivating E-Learners and Filtering Jobs for Candidates,"Early in the 1990s, recommender systems emerged to assist users in dealing with the cognitive overload caused by the internet. Since then, similar systems have expanded into many more capacities, such as assisting users in exploration, enhancing decision making, or even providing entertainment. Understanding the user task and how to modify the advice to assist it are made possible by these features. Recommender systems for education have been proposed in related research. These recommender systems assist students in locating the learning materials that best suit their requirements. One of the primary requirements of the online social platform is to engage the user in an effective way. For this purpose, online media starts to use gamification to improve the user participants. The reward system for online media widely uses gamification elements such as points, badges, etc. Thereby, in a badge-based system, an unachieved badge highly influences the gamification system. In this paper, unachieved and achievable badges were recommended using item-based collaborative filtering recommendation model. This enables us to gather information from the candidates and make accurate predictions about the jobs that might suit them. This is also durable in the sense that any missing data about the candidate does not affect the algorithm as a whole as it is capable of making assumptions regarding the missing data based on similar data already stored in the database. Beyond this, this algorithm can be employed to host courses on the website. The empirical observation shows that the proposed model has recommended the badge with 70 percent accuracy.

A Comparative Study of Coverage Hole Detection Techniques in Wireless Sensor Networks,"In crucial applications, sensor node coverage of the objective zone must be stabilized in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). A network with holes in coverage is more susceptible to node failures or malicious attacks. According to the total number of hops used to transport data, nodes may calculate their distance from the sink node. A coverage hole may be present if a node notices a much higher hop count than its neighbors. The network becomes more robust and resilient to diverse problems by proactively recognizing and correcting coverage holes. Coverage hole identification aids in the efficient use of network resources. By identifying places with poor coverage, resources such as electricity and bandwidth may be efficiently deployed to increase coverage in specific areas or extend the network lifetime overall. However, some node sensors die while the network operates due to energy restrictions, which may disturb the inclusion of the objective zone, resulting in a coverage hole. Due to limited battery life, the existence of impediments and physical damage to sensor nodes, coverage holes may emerge in sensor networks. Early identification of coverage holes enables prompt maintenance and troubleshooting, which minimizes the need for future major and expensive replacements or reconfigurations. The loss on the region of interest may be calculated by locating the coverage holes and identifying the malfunctioning node that created it. This article discusses many coverage-hole-detecting methods, classification approaches, and different performance comparison assessments. Compared to conventional techniques for detecting coverage holes, the investigated methods contribute to the universal viewpoint on holes and compute the number of holes quite precisely.

A Secure Framework for Communication and Data Processing in Web Applications,"Web applications are widely used, and the applications deployed on the web do not always satisfy all the security policies. This may arise due to less secure configurations, less knowledge in security configurations, or due to insecure coding practices. Even though a lot of practices are available, a lot of security loopholes are still available for hackers to steal information. A secure web application framework is discussed here which incorporates solutions to major security loopholes that attackers may use for stealing information or compromising systems. The security framework proposed here ensures an encrypted data transfer making the data safe and server-side vulnerability detection and avoidance for major attacks like SQLinjection (SQLi) and Cross Site Scripting (XSS). The client side of the framework is responsible for validations, encryption, and session management through a JavaScript module. The server side of the framework is responsible for decryption and validation, data management, and URL management. The framework deployed with PHP showed a good outcome when tested with the Arachni web application security scanner. The framework will be further studied for performance with huge workloads. Further, the work will be extended to cover other attacks.

Enhancing Virtual Experiences: A Holistic Approach to Immersive Special Effects,"To create a more immersive experience, electronic content developers utilize hardware solutions that not only display images and produce sounds but also manipulate the viewer’s real environment. These devices can control visual effects like lighting variations and fog, emit scents, simulate liquid effects, and provide vibration or locomotion sensations, such as moving the viewer’s chair. The goal is to emulate additional sensations for the viewers and engender the belief that they are truly present within the virtual environment. These devices are typically found in specially designed cinemas referred to as xD cinemas, such as 4D, 5D, 9D, etc., where each effect is treated as an additional dimension, enhancing the overall experience. Currently, all of these effects are triggered by timers. The system determines which effect to play based on timers. This approach is problematic, for it requires programming each device for each movie. In this research, we address this problem by introducing the idea of Special Effect Tags (SETs) that can be added in the subtitle files. The SETs aim to serve as a standard that will allow the various devices to know when each artificial phenomenon should be triggered. They are generic and can support infinite artificial phenomena, also known as dimensions. This paper introduces the idea of a common special effect framework and a generic architecture of a special effects player that is independent of any specific hardware solutions.

Ecotoxicity of Wastewater in the Czech Republic,"The following article is intended as an introduction to ecotoxicology/wastewater toxicology, as this has currently become a widespread and highly discussed topic with scarce information available to date. With the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when disinfectants began to be used in larger quantities, problems also began at wastewater treatment plants. This situation was the reason for beginning to monitor the ecotoxicity/toxicity of the wastewater flowing into the studied wastewater treatment plant; the wastewater treatment plant entered a state of emergency and was unable to treat the inflowing wastewater. In this critical period, the following parameters were monitored at the inflow of the wastewater treatment plant—BOD5, CHSKCr, NL, N-NH4, N-inorg, N-total, P-total, RAS and pH. The effluent from the wastewater treatment plant was also monitored for BOD5, CHSKCr, NL, N-NH4, N-NO3, N-NO2, N-inorg, N-total, P-total and RAS. Ecotoxicity (fish, barnacles, algae) and toxicity (Vibrio fischeri) were monitored at the inflow and outflow.

Timing Matters: Impact of Meal Timing on Daily Calorie Intake of Office Workers,"This research aims to investigate the role of meal timing on calorie intake. A database of a company’s cafeteria was used to track employees’ food-purchasing behaviors. The findings show that starting meals early leads to an overall reduction in total daily calorie intake. However, the effect of meal timing differed between meals, with breakfast timing having the most significant impact followed by lunch and dinner timings. In terms of calorie intake per meal, breakfast timing was a decisive factor, followed by dinner, and lunch timing showed a weaker correlation to lunch intake. This result implied that early breakfast and dinner were important in managing calorie intake, while lunch timing had a lower impact. This research is a guide on how to lose weight or boost overall health through an appropriate dietary habit.

Establishment of a Predictive Model for Cold Forging Force in Fastener Manufacturing Using Numerical Analysis,"Precise metal parts are manufactured using cold forged screw forming, but this method has drawbacks such as material damage and the possibility of imprecise parts. To ensure the accuracy and quality of parts, it is crucial to analyze and predict the forging force in this process. There are various methods to predict the forging force including laboratory testing, numerical simulation techniques, and simulation techniques. To provide forging information that cannot be measured by forging-forming machines, we simulated the nut-forming process based on actual manufacturing conditions using SolidWorks (v2020) with DEFORM-3D (v6.1). The results showed that the performance of the prediction of forging force specifications by the currently available nut-forming machines was improved by 8−20%. As the product becomes larger, the difference in forging force also increases proportionally. This research result, combined with appropriate experimental analysis, can be used as parameter controls for manufacturers in the future implementation of smart manufacturing.

On the Sensitivity of Potential Evapotranspiration in Egypt to Different Dynamical Downscaling Options and Boundary Layer Schemes Using a High-Resolution Regional Climate Model,"Accurate information on potential evapotranspiration (PET) is mandatory for arid regions (such as Egypt) to assess crop water requirements. Such precision is limited by the dynamical downscaling options and the physical settings used in regional climate models (like the RegCM4). To address these issues, four simulations were run as part of the current study. The first two simulations take direct (DIR) and one-way nesting (NEST) into account, while the other two use two boundary layer techniques (HOLTSLAG; HOLT) and (the University of Washington; UW). All simulations were driven via an ERA-Interim reanalysis of 1.5 degrees. The simulated PET was evaluated for the high-resolution reanalysis gridded derived product of ERA5-Land (hereafter ERA5). The findings revealed no discernible difference between DIR and NEST regarding global incident solar radiation (RSDS). Also, NEST had a higher mean air temperature (TMP) than DIR. Additionally, UW had a lower TMP than HOLT, but switching between HOLT and UW did not significantly impact the simulated RSDS. Concerning PET, it is neither affected by DIR and NEST nor HOLT and UW. Such results suggest that the RSDS is the main driver in controlling PET variability, followed by TMP. Therefore, by using the DIR downscaling option and UW boundary layer scheme throughout the period of 1990–2020, as recommended by the World Meteorological Organization, the RegCM4 can be used to develop a regional PET map of Egypt.

Rapid Chloride Permeability Test of Mortar Samples with Various Admixtures,"This paper is focused on the permeability of cement composite samples with various admixtures. Permeability was examined by the rapid chloride permeability test due to the simple and relatively quick performance among the many methods. Permeability is one of the durability parameters considering the pore system of the composite structure. Ion diffusion provides information about inner pore structure by passing a charge through the sample. In real-life conditions, not only chlorides but also other ions can penetrate into the structure and cause corrosion. Various cement supplements were used as admixtures. The reference sample consisted of cement, fine sand, and water, while the rest of the samples consisted of 20% blast furnace slag, bypass dust, eggshells or recycled glass instead of the cement. The results showed lower permeability in samples containing blast furnace slag and eggshells and a higher charge passage in samples with recycled glass and bypass dust than for the reference sample.

Predicting Consumer Preferences by the Deformation Threshold of Product Appearance,"Product appearance is essential in shaping consumers’ preferences. Thus, we predicted consumer preference by establishing a feasible threshold for appearance innovation with a novel method. We used deep learning (DL)-based image classification and the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) as the implementation tool. Advanced DL algorithms were adopted to classify images of disparate products according to their aesthetics. The results of the classification presented that the method could explain the level of innovation in appearance that consumers favored. The result can be used as a guideline for industrial designers in the creation of new products. Moreover, the method can be used to assess existing products that need enhancement to meet consumer preferences. The proposed method assists industrial designers in understanding consumer preferences and product innovation. Future research is required to ensure the successful design of new products.

Enhancing Flood Resilience: Streamflow Forecasting and Inundation Modeling in Pakistan,"Climatic changes have increased the frequency of natural disasters, and Pakistan, as a developing nation, is facing severe challenges in coping with floods, which have devastatingly impacted people’s livelihoods. In 2022, floods affected over 33 million people, resulting in more than 1730 deaths, according to the World Bank. Flood prediction is a critical research area which can aid in saving critical lives, crops, livestock, and money. This study employs machine learning techniques to provide accurate and reliable flood forecasts for Pakistan. Specifically, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial neural network (ANN) are utilized in this research for flood prediction. Historical data encompassing floods, rainfall, temperature, water level, topographic information, and land cover of Pakistan is collected and split into 75% for model training and 25% for testing. Additionally, topographic data and land cover information are employed to create inundation maps. The findings highlight three topographic factors that play a pivotal role in predicting flood-sensitive areas: slope, distance to the river, and river. The combined Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial neural network (ANN) exhibited areas under the curve values of 0.94 and 0.95 for the training and testing phases, respectively. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the SVM and ANN integration for precise flood forecasting in Pakistan, contributing to enhancing flood resilience in the region.

Tafamidis Drug Delivery Systems Based on Chitosan/Polyvinyl Alcohol Matrix,"Cardiovascular diseases retain their position as the leading cause of death globally, and according to the World Health Organization, there are 17.9 million cases of these diseases each year. Cardiac amyloidosis caused by the formation and deposition of a specific protein–polysaccharide complex–amyloid in the myocardium represents the main cause of death. The pharmaceutical molecules clinically used against amyloidosis are very limited; currently, there are only two non-selective hydrophobic agents—diflunisal and tafamidis. In addition to the non-selective mode of action of both drugs, tafamidis, with greater therapeutic efficacy, is the most expensive: the yearly course costs appr. USD 225,000. One of the possible ways of enhancing its solubility and bioavailability, decreasing the dosage with the simultaneous targeted effect, is the encapsulation of the drug into polymer (biopolymer) matrixes. In contrast to the known diflunisal delivery systems, there are no available data on the development of tafamidis delivery systems. In this study, we report, for the first time, a method for the encapsulation of tafamidis into a polymeric matrix based on the mixture of chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The release profile of the polymer matrix was analyzed, and no burst characteristic was demonstrated. The obtained tafamidis-loaded polymer matrixes based on biosafe and biocompatible polymers require further investigations in vitro and in vivo to evaluate their potential for clinical application.

Evaluation of Genetic Characteristics of Introduced Mung Bean Varieties Based on Agronomic Traits,"Mung beans make up a relatively large part of the daily needs of every Vietnamese family. However, mung bean yield in the Mekong Delta is still low, and variety is one of the main factors affecting this problem. Therefore, the study of new varieties with a high yield and adaptability to different environmental conditions is extremely necessary. We evaluated genetic characteristics such as productivity and growth time of the introduced mung beans based on agronomic traits (plant height at flowering, plant height at harvesting, number of internodes, number of branches, number of pods plant−1, and theoretical yield), thereby creating a database of genetic characteristics for further breeding programs. The results showed that the mature pods of all varieties were harvested up to two times after one planting season. The broad-sense heritability of studied traits including plant height at flowering and harvesting, number of internodes and branches, number of pods plant−1, and theoretical yield varied from 15.57% to 85.71% in the first harvest and from 68.45% to 89.58% in the second harvest. It can be seen that these traits were influenced by the environment. Hence, it is important to choose appropriate seasons to enhance the potential of the mung bean variety. Moreover, the correlation coefficient results showed a strong positive relationship between yield and the number of pods per plant, indicating that the number of pods plant−1 is one of the important factors affecting mung bean yield. Based on important agronomic traits including the number of pods per plant, 1000 seeds’ weight, growth time, and yield, two promising mung bean varieties were selected, which were VC 6494-986-S7 and VC 6518-50. Our results provided useful information for improving the yield of mung beans as well as contributing to the introduced mung bean breeding program in Vietnam.

Thus, we presented a case study in which the extent to which a chair was recognized as a typical Apple product was predicted. In the technique, Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) was used. The results show that the industrial designer can use product typicality for the image classification of products to manage the style of a brand and its products.

"RG-Based (k, n)-Threshold Visual Cryptography with Abilities of OR and XOR Decryption","A (k, n) visual cryptography (VCS) is used to build a system for secret sharing. The system divides a secret image (S) into n shares and recovers S by stacking shares bigger than or equal to k, while shares below k provide no information about S. The fundamental idea of VCS is that, rather than relying on mathematical or cryptographic skills, human vision can be used to decrypt the secret image. Typically, a Boolean OR operation can be used to indicate the stacking action in a VCS. The reconstructed secret image gradually darkens as more shares are stacked. However, this intractable issue can be overcome by designing an XOR-based VCS that uses the Boolean XOR operator rather than the OR operation. This indicates that by using the XOR-based VCS, higher image quality can be attained. Because the XOR operation requires the use of additional equipment, scholars consider that when no equipment is available, the traditional OR operation can still be used to reveal the secret images. That is, the secret image can be decrypted without a computing device by stacking enough shares, and if a lightweight computing device is available, a better-quality image can be produced via an XOR operation. In 2015, an RG-based (k, n) VCS to restore the secret image by using an OR or XOR operation was proposed. In this study, we improve the scheme and design a new (k, n) VCS, called (k, n) 2D_VCS to encrypt a secret image into n shares. The secret image can be recovered when k or more shares are gathered and stacked (OR operation) together or when an XOR procedure is utilized. Both the theoretical proof and experimental results show that the quality of the restored image obtained by our method is better than that of the previous methods.

The Removal of Selected Pharmaceuticals from Water by Adsorption with Granular Activated Carbons,"The article deals with the removal of 20 selected drugs from drinking water by sorption on granulated activated carbon. Two different sorption materials were used, and the efficiency of removing these micropollutants was compared. Experiments were performed in laboratory conditions with two different values of pH of water (7.8 and 6.5, respectively), at laboratory temperatures and with an identical amount of added sorbent (Filtrasorb 400, WG12). Standard additions were made to drinking water, and the final concentration of 0.44–0.55 µg/L of pharmaceuticals was utilized in the experiments. Samples were taken after 30, 60, 120 and 240 min of contact of sorbent with water. The LC-MS method was used to analyze the selected pharmaceuticals, which was performed at the ALS laboratory in Prague, Czech Republic. The adsorption efficiency of the removal of the given pharmaceuticals from water, as well as the adsorption capacity of the granulated activated carbon for the given pharmaceuticals, depends on amount of time that the water and material were in contact. The adsorption efficiency for two different types of granulated activated carbon ranges from 13 to 90%. Water pH also influences the sorption abilities of granulated activated carbon.

Phytotoxicity Assessment of Wastewater from Industrial Pulp Production,"During the production of pulp from natural raw materials, such as wood, large amounts of waste are generated. When they are reused, e.g., in agriculture, ecological requirements towards the environment must be met, and the associated risks must be known. In the framework of this study, the phytotoxicity of liquid waste generated during the industrial processing of pulp using the sulfite process was investigated. The results of semichronic toxicity tests on Lepidium sativum L. and Sinapis alba L. showed a direct effect on the growth and development of plants and proved that the undiluted samples were phytotoxic. However, the phytotoxicity of the investigated waste samples was influenced by their dilution ratio. Thus, finding the optimal solution ratio is crucial for the reuse of liquid waste. A nonphytotoxic effect on the roots of the tested plants was proven with a solution in a ratio of 1:100. In addition, the control samples diluted with a medium manifested phytotoxicity due to the activity of internal microorganisms.

Implementation of A Data-Acquisition System and Its Cloud-Based Registration Using the Unified Architecture of Open Platform Communications,"Standardization and collaborative integration are fundamental for the implementation of Industry 4.0. The Open Communication Platform Unified Architecture (OPC UA) standard plays a crucial role in communication by enabling the development of heterogeneous systems and facilitating the seamless exchange of data between devices. To take full advantage of OPC UA’s capabilities, it is necessary to unlock other application services, such as cloud computing. By having more tools at their disposal, industries can increase their efficiency and optimize data-driven decision making. In this study, it was proposed to use OPC UA standard in a Client/Server model to leverage OPC UA paradigms along with Software Development Kits (SDKs). The development was carried out using Python as the programming language, both to host the server on a Raspberry Pi 4B and to set up the client on a Personal Computer (PC). This client will centralize the data for sending to the Clever Cloud logging platforms and for web visualization on Tago.IO. The interoperability problem of communicating between two platforms with different Operating Systems (OS) was addressed by integrating the OPC UA standard. The configured interval of 10 s recorded an average of 11.11 s, with a maximum timeout of 59 s for data-logging temperature, pressure, humidity, and altitude. The client proved to be Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) compliant, allowing connection to Web platforms.

Production of Polymeric Membranes Based on Activated Carbons for Wastewater Treatment,"Comprising advanced materials like polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) for mechanical stability and biofouling prevention and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for hydrophilicity, membranes enable selective filtration, retaining larger particles and external contaminants in wastewater treatment. Incorporating activated carbon during manufacturing is a strategic approach to enhance membrane (AC-CO2 membrane) properties, leveraging its high surface area and adsorption capacity. This study produced mixed polymeric membranes by combining PVDF, PVP, and activated carbon (AC-CO2), using N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as the solvent. These membranes were employed for the filtration of phenolic compounds, particularly phenol. In an AC-CO2 membrane formulation with 1.3 g of PVP, 1.15 g of PVDF, 8.8 mL of NMP, and 2.5 g of AC-CO2, with thickness variations of 150 µm and 300 µm, approximately 56.77% and 90.35% of 50 mg/L of phenol in model wastewater were removed within 5 min, respectively, with breakthrough occurring at 15 min. Finally, this study developed a hydrophilic membrane with alkaline characteristics and a neutral pH point of zero charge (pHPZC), establishing the feasibility of employing these membranes to treat model wastewater containing phenolic compounds. The prospect of scaling up for practical applications presents a promising avenue for future investigations.

Development and Characterization of Biomass Pellets Using Yard Waste,"In Pakistan, energy production from nuclear, hydro, and gas sources is about 99%, and only 1% is produced from renewable energy resources. Biomass is an emerging renewable resource for Pakistan obtained by converting loose biomass into pellets of high density. In this regard, biomass is receiving more and more attention day by day due to its abundant availability. Due to improper management of biomass in terms of transportation, handling, storing, and lack of awareness, its use for energy production is very low. The environmental and health effects of dumping and incineration techniques are becoming more dangerous for developing countries and rural communities day by day. The densification technique is a currently emerging technology for developing countries. Pellet development using yard waste is a new concept that can meet energy demands in addition to reducing environmental pollution and sources of waste management. For this purpose, the biomass of yard waste was shredded and then dried under sunlight or open drying to reduce the moisture content in the biomass material to less than 16% before being carbonized. Five samples with different moisture content levels were made and pellets were prepared from them. The results achieved by the characterization of pellets show that yard waste pellets at 5% moisture content had the highest calorific value of about 17.76 MJ/kg. Flue gas analysis was carried out and emissions from all were determined at all five moisture contents.

A Robust Deep Learning-Based Approach for Detection of Breast Cancer from Histopathological Images,"Breast cancer is a frequently encountered and potentially lethal illness that can affect not only women but also men. It is the most common disease affecting women globally, and is the main cause of morbidity and death. Early and accurate detection of this risky disease is crucial. A timely and precise identification of breast cancer can decrease death rate and can also protect people from additional damage. The traditional methods used for breast cancer detection are very expensive in term of time and cost. The goal of this study is to develop a system which can detect the breast cancer accurately and at an early stage. The primary objective of this research study is to make use of histopathological images to identify breast cancer correctly and faster. In the proposed research work, we have developed a model with the name Breast Cancer Detection Network (BCDecNet), which comprises eleven learnable layers, i.e., eight convolution layers and three fully connected (FC) layers. The architecture has a total of twenty-nine layers, including one input layer, seven leaky ReLu (LR) layers, four ReLu layers, five maximum-pooling layers, six batch-normalization (BN) layers, one cross-channel normalization layer and three dropout layers, a softmax layer, and a classification layer. The proposed work uses image-based data taken from the Kaggle online repository. The suggested model achieved 97.33% accuracy, 96% precision, 96.5% recall and a 96.25% F1 score. Furthermore, the result of the proposed model was compared with other hybrid approaches used for diagnosis of breast cancer at early stages. Our model achieved a more satisfactory result than all other approaches used for breast cancer detection. Additionally, the proposed BCDecNet model can be generally applied to other medical-image datasets for diagnosis of various diseases.

Drought Monitoring with Multiple Indices and Management through Various Techniques: A Review,"Drought is a complex natural disaster with significant implications for agriculture, water resources, and socioeconomic development. Accurate and timely assessment of meteorological drought is crucial for effective management and mitigation strategies. Climate change has led to a rise in climatic anomalies, such as droughts, floods, heatwaves, and cold snaps, which have severe impacts on human well-being and societal patterns. Droughts, which are prolonged periods of limited or absent rainfall, pose significant challenges for sectors like agriculture, energy, and enterprises, especially in economically reliant countries with inadequate water management infrastructure. Drought indicators are essential in meteorology, agriculture, and hydrology for monitoring drought conditions. Accurate drought assessment relies on quantitative index-based comprehensive drought indices, such as India’s Aridity Anomaly Index (AAI), Deciles Index, Percent of Normal Index, Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Drought management involves analyzing risk components and using analytical tools for decision making. A decision support system includes institutional, methodological, public, and operational components. Long-term actions include demand reduction through economic incentives, while short-term actions include increasing water supply through wastewater reutilization, inter-basin water conveyance, reservoir construction, and agricultural ponds. Impact minimization is achieved through educational initiatives, reallocating water resources, early warning systems, and insurance programs. Challenges include developing technologies to integrate data sources and create unified indicators, and geospatial decision-support systems facilitate hazard mapping and strategic drought management plans.

Laetiporus sulphureus Mushroom Enhances Cytotoxic Effect of Bifidobacterium animalis spp. lactis on HCT-116 Cells in a Co-Culture System,"The study aimed to test the effect of probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis spp. lactis (BAL) on the HCT-116 cell line viability and to compare its effect with co-treatment BAL/Laetiporus sulphureus (EALS). The trypan blue staining method was used to estimate HCT-116 viability. The levels of NO2− were determined using 0.1% N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine, as well as 1% sulfanilic acid. The determination of H2O2 was based on the oxidation of phenol red. Our results showed the significant cytotoxicity of the BAL on the HCT-116 cells in a co-culture system, while the BAL/EALS co-treatment further enhanced the cytotoxicity on the HCT-116 cells. We detected higher H2O2 and NO2− values in treatments with BAL, especially in the BAL/EALS co-treatment. The death of the HCT-116 cells may be due to elevated levels of H2O2 and NO2− and their products (peroxynitrites).

Adaptive Type-1 Fuzzy Controller for Lag-Dominant First and Second Order Nonlinear Systems,"Most of the current day industries are suffering from nonlinear processes. Thus, both the stability and the process performance of high-degree nonlinear systems with dominating delay might be difficult to achieve. Adaptive and intelligent fuzzy classifiers and controllers have been more popular in recent years as a means of overcoming a significant number of difficulties faced by the industrial sector. A large number of dynamic process plants with a variety of orders and kinds have been represented heuristically and recognized. Fuzzy structures have also been employed for these interactive systems by making use of fuzzy and linguistic techniques. In view of all these initiatives, the purpose of this paper is to conduct an experimental investigation into the performance of a LabVIEW-based Type-1 Adaptive Mamdani Fuzzy Controller (AMFC) that has been designed and applied over a lag-dominant and a second-order nonlinear Dual Input Tank System (DITS) and Single Input Tank System (SITS). Compared to other type-1 approaches that were previously experimented with and are now in existence, the adaptability of AMFC demonstrates that it is quite effective. Performance indices such as the Integrated/Summated Absolute Error (IAE) and the Integrated/Summated Squared Error (ISE) are also computed for several variable set point profiles of DITS. These indices measure errors in integrated absolute value and integrated squared value, respectively. Adaptive Type-1 Intelligent Fuzzy Controller’s response and error reduction efficiency have been found for several flow configurations of DITS, namely Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) and Single Input Single Output (SISO). From the results, it can be concluded that the proposed experimental validation may be used for a wide variety of process challenges that are experienced in industrial systems to achieve robust and low error controller performances.

An Overview of Machine Learning Techniques for Sediment Prediction,"Most hydrological and water resources researchers prioritize the development of an accurate sediment prediction model. Several conventional techniques have failed to accurately predict suspended sediment. Because of the intricacy, non-stationarity, and nonlinearity of sediment movement behavior in streams and rivers, many techniques fall short. Over the last several years, there have been meaningful theoretical improvements in the understanding of machine learning approaches, vis a vis strategy for the implementation of their processes and uses of the technique for practical and hydrological issues. To produce the desired output, machine learning models and other algorithms have been employed to predict complicated nonlinear connections and patterns of huge input parameters. This paper examines a few key works of the literature on sediment transport prediction while focusing on a variety of machine learning applications. Sediment transport models aided by machine learning have attracted a growing number of researchers in recent years. As a result, they must gain in-depth knowledge of their theory and modeling methodologies. Furthermore, this chapter includes an overview of the machine learning technique and other developing hybrid models that have produced promising outcomes. This overview also includes various examples of successful machine learning applications in sediment prediction.

Toward the Development of Plasmonic Biosensors to Realize Point-of-Care Tests for the Detection of Viruses and Bacteria,"Optical fiber biosensors can be used to develop point-of-care tests (POCTs) for detecting viruses and bacteria in several matrices. In particular, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and localized SPR phenomena (LSPR) can be excited by exploiting low-cost and small-size optical fiber chips. Generally, SPR or LSPR sensors are realized using several kinds of modified optical fibers (silica, plastic, or specialty) or by exploiting other optical waveguides (e.g., slab, spoon-shaped waveguides, etc.). More specifically, optical fiber sensors can be classified as intrinsic or extrinsic. In the “optical fiber intrinsic sensors”, the sensing area is realized in the optical fiber directly, such as in the case of plasmonic platforms based on D-shaped plastic optical fibers (POFs), tapered optical fibers, U-bend POFs, or light-diffusing fibers (LDFs). By contrast, when an optical fiber is used as a mere waveguide allowing for the launch of light to the sensing region and its collection, it is defined as an extrinsic optical fiber sensor, like in the case of the plasmonic sensors realized by Cennamo et al. using POFs combined with spoon-shaped waveguides, 3D-printed platforms, bacterial cellulose waveguides, nanogratings, and InkJet-printed chips. To realize optical biosensor chips for the detection of viruses and bacteria, both intrinsic and extrinsic plasmonic POF sensors can be efficiently combined with receptors specific for membrane proteins, either biological (e.g., antibodies, aptamers, enzymes, etc.) or synthetic (e.g., molecularly imprinted polymers), to build groundbreaking POCTs.

"Statistical Analysis of Handover Process Performance in a Cellular Mobile Network in the City of Quito, Ecuador","This paper presents an overview of the findings in the handover (HO) process performance within three routes in Quito, Ecuador. We used the Net-Monitor Software to gather information from one of the three national mobile operators. Then, we used the R tool to analyze the HO performance. We analyze several performance metrics, such as HO types, HO conditions, and the ping-pong process. Analysis of the results of the outdoor drive tests demonstrate that the radio frequency (RF) parameters, such as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ), power margin, times radio frequency measurements repeats, and HO percentage to nearest BS, are extremely important during different HO types and ping-pong processes because there are statistical differences in these measured RF parameters. The main measurement results demonstrate that RSSI difference between inter HO and intra HO is 20 dB, whereas HOs are performed when the mobile device (MS) gets farther from the base station (BS), approximately 50% of total HOs. Operator achieves a high ping-pong rate of approximately 10% of total HOs.

Development of a New Heat Source Based on Inducing Heat for Greenhouses,"In Fukuroi City Japan, greenhouses are usually used for crown musk melon (CMM) cultivation. When the temperature inside the greenhouse is lower than 25 °C, the CMM quality deteriorates. Hence, from late autumn until the middle of spring, oil is used to supply hot water to greenhouses from a boiler through a heat exchanger . However, since oil prices have recently soared, fuel expenses have drastically increased which heavily pressures the CMM business. In addition, with the promotion of the carbon-neutral policy, environmentally friendly heat sources are emphasized instead of fossil fuels. The TSK corporation has produced a new inducing heating (IH) source where heat is generated by rotating a plate on which a couple of permanent magnets are mounted using a motor. Since the rotation speed is easily controlled, the IH heat source capacity can be freely adjusted. To apply the IH source to the greenhouse, an experimental system was created in this study. During the experiment, water inside a vessel (maximum volume of 90 L) was heated to 70 °C by the IH system. Then, the heated water was circulated for heat dissipation through a heat exchanger by a pump. When the temperature of the water was lower than the target temperature, the IH system restarted to heat the water back up to 70 °C. Under several experimental conditions, the heating time, reheating time, and electric power were measured and evaluated. It was confirmed that the new IH heat source could possibly be applied to greenhouses.

This paper’s main objective is to examine the performance of a unique velostat-based pressure sensor system for supplying real-time grasping pressure profiles during the lifting of calibrated weights. Copper conductive tape was used to build the sensor, and it was positioned on top of and beneath a velostat sheet to serve as an electrode. The accuracy, repeatability, and hysteresis responses of the pressure sensor system were examined through a variety of experiments, as well as through testing with calibrated weights ranging from 100 gm to 2000 gm in steps. The sensor’s hysteresis and nonlinear characteristics were discovered through the experimental results of loading cycle measurements. Velostat proved to be a realistic option as a sensitive material for sensors with a single electrode pair, depending on the sensor’s sensitivity, hysteresis, reaction time, loading conditions, and deformation. The area where the velostat sensor might be implemented was verified by experimental results.

"Prediction Model for Preoperative Diagnosis of Ovarian Cancer Using Tumor Markers, CBC, and LFT","The preoperative diagnosis of ovarian cancer (OC) was developed based on risk factor groups using secondary data. Binary and multiple logistic regression and its operating characteristic curve were used to analyze the data of risk factor groups for tumor markers, complete blood count (CBC), and liver function tests (LFT), respectively, and to explore potential predictors for each risk factor group. The data of 202 patients with ovarian cancer were analyzed in this research. As the tumor markers group, menopausal status, human epididymal protein 4, and cancer antigen 19-9 were included as the derivation of the preoperative diagnosis index. For the CBC group, menopausal status, lymphocyte count, and basophil cell ratio were used as predictors. Menopausal status, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, and indirect bilirubin were used as predictors for the LFT group. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for tumor markers, CBC, and LFT were 0.89 (95% CI, 0.845–0.935; sensitivity = 0.776, specificity = 0.919), 0.813 (95% CI, 0.755–0.871; sensitivity = 0.741, specificity = 0.767), and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.751–0.868; sensitivity = 0.664, specificity = 0.837), respectively.

Influence of Interior Decorations on Indoor Air Quality in Fitness Centers,"In order to understand the air quality of fitness centers according to the Environmental Protection Administration’s “Indoor Air Quality Standards”, as well as to discuss how fitness center air-conditioning ventilation systems can effectively remove indoor air pollutants, this study focused on six Taichung fitness centers in a seven-sample air quality investigation, employing handheld precision instruments in space air testing and using linear regression analyses of the concentrations of indoor chemical pollutants, including factors such as temperature, relative humidity, CO2, O3, CO, CH2O, TVOC, PM2.5, and PM10. The results of this research are as follows: (1) Quantity of indoor decorations: The decorative materials used in each of the sample spaces and their sources are not the same. Even with the same quantity of decorations, the concentrations of CH2O and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) that escaped into the atmosphere were different across the samples, leading to a low correlation (R = 0.0316, R = −0.0976). Our findings on the influence of the fitness center’s establishment date on the concentrations of formaldehyde (CH2O) and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) that escaped into the indoor air indicate that this correlation is low and insignificant (R = −0.3598, R = −0.5523), but show that the indoor concentration of formaldehyde decreases with time. (2) Occupants’ indoor activities: The CO2 concentration generated by the static and dynamic activities of indoor occupants is not reflected in real time but will gradually accumulate, resulting in a moderate to low and insignificant correlation between the number of active occupants and the level of CO2 (R = 0.4343). (3) The PM2.5 and PM10 sources of suspended particles are not only related to the external air and interior decoration materials, but also to coarse surfaces, which can easily attract dust accumulation. Therefore, materials made from fabric and artificial turf should be reduced in order to reduce dust accumulating on the materials’ surfaces.

A Preliminary Study on Taiwanese Sexual Rights from Medical and Legal Perspective,"Under the influence of sexually conservative Chinese culture, sex has always been an untouchable issue for a long time. As “Sex” has been a long-standing social taboo, sex-related knowledge and discourses have become scarce. The knowledge of the majority of Taiwanese on sex has been obtained from banned books and videos such as porn videos. This made people have the worst knowledge and information on it. No matter how open people are, the ability to feel sexuality rights among sexuality, sexuality education, sexology, trans/Gender studies, and LesBiGay due to the sexual legal norms (SLNs) in Taiwan is always lacking. Therefore, not only can young Taiwanese people enjoy the thrill of riding on the sexual waves, but as time passes, old Taiwanese people are also supposed to enjoy themselves without any pressure from society. Therefore, we developed sexual education on Taiwanese sexuality rights from a legal perspective by integrating the four essential SLNs: (1) the Sexual Harassment Prevention Act was instituted for establishing the sources of law in the various sexuality interactive behaviors; (2) the Act of Gender Equality in Employment was instituted for providing sources of law to promote male and female sexual employment; (3) the Communicable Disease Control Act was instituted for constructing the sources of law to prevent the STDs; and (4) the Gender Equity Education Act was instituted for instituting the sources of law. There is still unfair and unbalanced sexual violence in the current society. Thus, a future study is required to analyze and identify the legal determinants of sexual rights. For this, empirical suggestions were made to form more efficient SLNs for a harmonious and diverse Taiwanese society.

Application of Tabu Search for Job Shop Scheduling Based on Manufacturing Order Swapping,"Due to the characteristics of small-volume-large-variety production in the aircraft industry, determining how to intelligently take men, machines, materials, methods, and environments into account is critical for production, posing the challenge of scheduling the job shop. The existing scheduling system is slow to adapt when the requirements change and, most importantly, slow to consider the current situation of the production line. In this study, we apply the Tabu search algorithm to resolve the scheduling problem. This method swaps manufacturing orders with the consideration of the due date, working hours, and current delays via the finite capacity assumption. Meanwhile, we set up extreme bounds using the infinite capacity assumption for comparison. The case study is conducted in a work center that uses pliers to trim parts for use in the aircraft industry. The results show the closeness to the extreme bounds and indicate this method’s practical feasibility for industrial applications.

The Traditions and Technologies of Ecological Construction in Portugal,"This paper identifies the main factors that shape energy poverty. Based on the analysis of statistical, regulatory documentation, as well as the state of the housing stock in Portugal, a number of new factors have been identified that are inherent in developed countries. The factors that shape energy poverty include the low energy efficiency of buildings, lack of access to energy-efficient sources, imperfect regulatory framework in the construction sector, and low level of public awareness of loans to cover energy-related needs. In view of this, it can be argued that energy poverty is not a problem of Third World countries only but is a global problem that will become even more acute as we move to clean and energy-efficient resources. To overcome the problems of energy poverty, the experience of Portugal was analysed. It was found that the practice of granting loans to reimburse the cost of energy purchases is not effective. Based on the analysis of government programmes and plans in Portugal, it was found that one of the most effective ways to overcome energy poverty is to ensure the energy certification of buildings. The incentive for the transition to certification is a set of state programmes on construction loans, allocation of funds for modernisation, etc. The identified factors and tools for stimulating energy efficiency improvement allow us to formulate a strategy for overcoming energy poverty, which includes energy certification of buildings, transition to more efficient and energy-saving heating means, lending to the population, and allocation of funds for modernisation.

Cyber Security in a 5G-Based Smart Healthcare Network: A Base Station Case Study,"5G is transforming the healthcare industry by providing novel use cases and applications. With a lower latency, a higher bandwidth, and massive machine-type communication capabilities, 5G supports the smart healthcare system in expanding its applications. This rapid adoption of 5G technology increased the number of connected devices. However, the deployment of 5G networks also introduced security challenges, especially for sensitive patient data which must be secured. Base stations are a key component in connecting devices to the mobile network and need to be secured. As unauthorized base stations cause interference or can be used as fake base stations to attack devices in the network, it is crucial to address the security concerns associated with 5G-based smart healthcare networks. Thus, we studied the case of base station security to investigate different methods for detecting and mitigating the risks associated with unauthorized base stations.

Effect of Ash from Biomass Combustion on Tailings pH,"This article deals with the use of ash from biomass burning for the remediation of thermally active dump in Heřmanice, Czech Republic. Nowadays, various chemical, physical, or biological methods of remediation are used for the remediation of dumps. The authors discuss the complex use of ash from biomass as a possibility for biological remediation of the Heřmanice dump. The main advantage of obtaining ash when burning biomass is primarily the fact that it is a renewable energy source, which produces electricity and large amounts of ash, which can be used, for example, for the remediation of the Heřmanice dump. Tailings are characterized by their acidity, while fly ash is characterized by high alkalinity. This study deals with which ratio (tailings:ash) would achieve the necessary neutral values in order to prevent the release of heavy metals into the surroundings of the Heřmanice dump. The value of the active soil reaction (pH/H2O), the value of the exchange soil reaction (pH/CaCl2), the value of hydrolytic acidity (Ha), together with the value of soluble salts in the tailings, i.e., electrical conductivity, were also studied. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that the addition of biomass combustion ash had a positive effect on the pH value of the tailings. Based on this fact, Al3+ is excreted more slowly into the environment. A higher content of aluminum is toxic to plants, while in a smaller amount, its content is necessary and at the same time an important factor in the process of plant growth. The mixing of alkaline ash with unburned surface tailings from the thermally active Heřmanice dump significantly influenced its acidity, which had a positive effect on increasing the active and exchange acidity.

Ancient Chinese Repeating Crossbow: Basic Research to Science Education in Museums,"The single-shot crossbow is an important ancient Chinese invention dating back to 600 B.C. It was a weapon using elastic force to shoot arrows at targets at a distance. It was composed of a stock, a bow, a string, and a trigger. By adding a magazine to a single-shot crossbow, the repeating crossbow was allowed to shoot repeatedly without hesitation by operating the operating handle. According to archaeological findings, the earliest repeating crossbow was excavated in Jiangling County, Hubei Province, China, and dated back to 400 B.C. Based on the restored design of ancient crossbows, we found six feasible designs of the earliest repeating crossbow. These designs adopted the mechanism of “six members and seven joints”. One feasible design was selected to construct its model, using computer animation as a DIY teaching aid. The research results can be used for STEM education in museum exhibitions.

The Effect of Incorporating Graphene Nanoplatelets in the Engineering of Cementitious Composites on Compressive and Tensile Strengths for Potential Applications as a Repair Material,"Repair methods have been adopted to restore the integrity of structures and ensure their safety and longevity. Although jacketing is commonly adopted as a repair method, its implementation results in added loads and a reduction in dimensions and free spacing. In view of the challenges associated with the implementation of jacketing, the development of ultra-high-performance engineered cementitious composites (UHPECCs) are frequently discussed in research as this can enable jacketing to be performed using thin layers of repair material due to the higher strength-to-weight ratio of UHPECCs compared to conventional repair materials. Therefore, the adoption of UHPECCs for jacketing can reduce the overall weight and thickness of the repair material while ensuring the longevity of the repair. At the same time, graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs), which are carbon-derived nanoparticles, are well-known to be unique and advanced nanomaterials with superior properties. In light of the exceptional strength properties of GnPs, the effect of incorporating GnPs in engineered cementitious composites (ECCs) on strength was studied in an effort to further advance UHPECC research. Compressive and tensile strength tests were conducted on ECC samples that contain GnPs added in amounts ranging from 0.03 to 0.09% of the binder weight. The results reveal that the incorporation of GnPs improved strength: the strength of GnP-UHPECC increased as GnP content increased, and compressive and tensile strengths substantially increased by up to 32.9 and 64.6%, respectively.

Modification of Aluminum 1050 and 2219 Alloys Using CuBr Nanosecond Laser for Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Properties,"This study investigates the use of a CuBr vapor nanosecond laser with a 510 nm/578.2 nm wavelength for the surface treatment of 1050 aluminum and 2219 aluminum alloys. Laser-induced periodic surface structuring was used to optimize processing parameters to achieve hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties on the surface. The wetting properties were measured and the roughness results (Ra, Rz, Rq) evaluated. Prior to and after laser treatment, surface wetting and roughness changes were investigated. The wetting study showed that the maximum contact angle between a droplet of deionized water and the treated surface can be reached between more than 140 degrees and less than 10 degrees, which, respectively, is a superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic surface. Compared with the untreated surface, wetting increased by more than 2 times and decreased by more than 8 times. Overall, experiments show the dependence of wetting properties on laser input parameters such as scan speed and scan line distance with different delivered energy amounts. This study demonstrates the possibility of laser parameter optimizations which do not require auxiliary gases and additional processing of the resulting surfaces to obtain different wetting properties on the surface. The findings described in this article suggest that the CuBr laser surface treatment method is a promising method for industrial applications where surfaces with special wetting and roughness properties are required, for example, the laser marking of the serial number of parts used in wet environments such as aerospace, shipbuilding, and defense industries.

Fractional-Order Predictive PI Controller-Based Dead-Time Compensator for Wireless Networks,"Wireless technology is increasingly significant in today’s industrial landscape. Standards like WirelessHART, ZigBee, and ISA100.11a are being widely used. However, despite their widespread use, wireless networks may sometimes be susceptible to packet loss or drops, making closed-loop systems vulnerable and resulting in system failure. To prevent such issues, dead-time compensation is necessary. The conventional techniques of predictive PI are commonly used for this purpose. Still, they must perform optimally for wireless networks with dead time, and set-point variations can affect network stability. To address this, a fractional calculus-based predictive PI compensator is proposed in this paper for wireless networks in process industries to improve the performance of these compensators. Industrial processes that involve wireless measurement and control actions in the pressure process model are used to evaluate the proposed compensator. The wireless network’s performance is assessed for packet loss, reduced throughput, and increased latency, and the proposed compensator outperforms traditional ones to achieve better set-point characteristics.

"Evaluating Scalability, Resiliency, and Load Balancing in Software-Defined Networking","With emerging technologies like cloud computing and big data, managing traditional networks has become more demanding. Software-defined networking (SDN) promises faster implementation, flexibility, and simplified network management. However, due to SDN’s centralized nature, it encounters limitations. SDN controllers should have enough processing power to deal with a high amount of flow. In addition, a single point of failure may affect the network’s resiliency. For these issues, multi-instance implementation enables distributed control. However, this solution implies an intrinsic controller-to-controller synchronization channel. In this article, we propose different failure scenarios in both the data and control planes to provide network administrators with a clear view of the constraints of network reliability, load balancing, and scalability in SDN environments. The simulation results show that, regarding resiliency, SDN networks require half the time compared to traditional networks in order to recover from a link failure. Regarding load-balancing capabilities, load balancing is not guaranteed with the reactive forwarding approach (on-demand flow installation). Lastly, the SDN multi-instance solution impacts the network performance by between 1% and 21% compared to the single-instance case.

Image Enhancement CNN Approach to COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-ray Images,"Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a fast-spreading virus-related disease. On 28 March 2022, Worldometer (COVID-19 live update) reported that there were about 482,338,923 COVID-19 cases and 6,149,387 fatalities worldwide. Moreover, there were about 416,884,712 recovered patients. The primary clinical mechanism currently utilized for COVID-19 identification is the Reverse Transcription–Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Hospitals only have small quantities of COVID-19 test kits available due to the daily increase in cases. As an alternative diagnosis possibility, an automatic detection system was implemented. A vigorous technique for the automatic COVID-19 identification is the deep learning approach. Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is a modest tool that can be an alternate for diagnosing COVID-19-infected patients. With the use of deep learning, deep layer characteristics that are hidden from human sight may be observed using CXR imaging. One of the largest public databases, the “COVID-19 Radiography Database”, comprises 21,164 CXR images and was taken from Kaggle. To achieve the best accuracy in this work, data cleansing and the balanced dataset approach were applied. The primary goal of data cleansing is to remove duplicate CXR images from the database. The accuracy of three distinct pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was compared and then analyzed (Xception, InceptionV3, and MobileNetV2). Among other models, Xception achieved the best testing accuracy of 94.13% with plain lung CXR pictures. The Gabor filtering image enhancement approach was also employed to identify COVID-19. Only for the MobileNetV2 model did enhance CXR images perform significantly better for classification than plain lung CXR images. This study attempts to enhance the system’s accuracy to 100%, outperforming previous tests.

Industrial Application of Photovoltaic Systems with Storage for Peak Shaving: Ecuador Case Study,"Decentralized generation has gained importance in the energy industry, since self-consumption with renewable resources presents attractive costs and allows load management actions. In this sense, photovoltaic generation systems are a promising technology. This work presents a proposal for a peak shaving system using solar photovoltaic (PV) energy and a battery storage system, known as battery energy storage systems (BESS), to be installed by an industrial customer to reduce energy consumption during peak hours. For the study, a hybrid approach is presented, starting from deterministic variables, such as the demand curve of the industry under study, and the generation of stochastic variables, such as the energy production of the photovoltaic system. For the analysis of the proposed peak shaving system, the design and sizing of the photovoltaic systems are developed in a base case of self-generation and an optimized system for the system to cover the energy demand generated during peak hours. The technical–economic study carried out in the research allowed us to determine the optimal power of the photovoltaic system with the storage system. The proposed system allows the integration of a peak shaving strategy from a certain power limit, in order to cover the peak demand over this power limit, allowing the system to be profitable under the current regulations and standards in Ecuador.

Regression Analysis to Investigate Contributions of Process Parameters on Transesterification of Waste Soybean Oil,"Four process parameters were investigated via regression analysis for their effects on biodiesel production in the transesterification of biodiesel from waste soybean oil (WSO). The maximum biodiesel conversion rate reached 98.56% at a methanol/oil ratio of 6:1, a reaction time of 60 min, a reaction temperature of 60 °C, and a catalyst loading of 0.5 wt.%. The functional group was dominated by an ester with the wavenumber 1743.78, the group attribution C=O, a strong absorption intensity, and a stretching vibration. The major methyl ester compounds of the biodiesel yielded from the waste soybean oil were dominated by linoleic acid (37.53%), oleic acid (24.69%), and palmitic acid (12.95%). The regression analysis result showed that the parameters influenced the biodiesel yield, and that the reaction temperature contributed to the reaction more than the others.

Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) Performance Evaluation for 5G/NR Networks at Different Positions of the User Equipment,"This article presents the implementation and the evaluation of a transmission–reception system for Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) within the context of fifth-generation cellular networks (5G/NR). The research focuses on characterizing the behavior of the PDCCH channel concerning different User Equipment (UE) positions through simulations conducted in MATLAB. Two scenarios are considered: a lossless system and a system with losses, where the outcomes are presented in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) vs. Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and BER vs. Transmit Power, respectively. One contribution of the paper is the explanation transmission–reception system for PDCCH in MATLAB, while the second contribution is the presentation of simulation results. From results, it was deduced that higher UE height corresponds to improved channel performance, greater UE elevation angle leads to enhanced channel performance, and increased carrier frequency results in reduced performance of the physical control PDCCH channel.

A Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Robotic Manipulation Tasks in Simulated Environments,"Industrial robots are used in a variety of industrial process tasks, and due to the complexity of the environment in which these systems are deployed, more robust and accurate control methods are required. Deep reinforcement learning emerges as a comprehensive approach that directly allows for the mapping of sensor data and the setting of motion actions to the robot. In this work, we propose a robotic system implemented in a semi-photorealistic simulator whose motion control is based on the A2C algorithm in a DRL agent; the task to be performed is to reach a goal within a work area. The evaluation is executed in a simulation scenario where a fixed position of a target is maintained while the agent (robotic manipulator) tries to reach it with the end-effector from an initial position. Finally, the trained agent fulfills the established task; this is demonstrated by the results obtained in the training and evaluation processes, and the reward value increases when the measured distance decreases between the end-effector and the target.

Performance Analysis of Motion Control Algorithms of an Industrial Robot Arm Applied to 3D Concrete Printing Systems,"This paper shows the implementation and performance analysis of motion control algorithms for a 3D Concrete Printing system based on an industrial robotic arm. This work is part of the project of digital fabrication of low-cost housing. Regarding the technological architecture integrated in the present work, the hardware devices used are the EPSON C12 industrial robot arm and the RC700-A controller, and the software tools are Fusion 360 and RC+. To evaluate the point extraction and sequencing algorithms of a 3D structure and the motion control algorithms of the robot arm, three test wall models were designed: a semi-circle with horizontal undulations, a semi-circle with vertical undulations and an orthohedron without undulations. For the performance analysis, 140 trajectory times were extracted for each test model. The extracted values are the trajectory time intervals of the wall model envelope for each layer and of the internal trajectory of the wall model infill. Due to the increasing and decreasing trends of time for specific cases, it was concluded that in the working area of the robot arm, there are parts in which the robot is more efficient and therefore the joints offer less inertia for certain types of movements, for example straight or curved movements and short or long movements.

Computational Representation of Cellular Lines: A Text Mining Approach,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of cancer drug research, cellular lines serve as invaluable tools for understanding drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tumors. The computational representation of cellular lines is usually based on genomic profiling, even though this method cannot be applied in a large scale. This study introduces a novel approach to the computational representation of cellular lines using text mining techniques. By meticulously extracting and analyzing textual data from the scientific literature, we developed a computational representation of these cellular lines. Our methodology encompassed advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text extraction and machine learning models for predictive analysis. We achieved a comprehensive description of each cellular line. To validate our findings, we generated a distance matrix for all cellular lines, leading to the construction of a dendrogram representing cellular line relationships. This dendrogram shows a resemblance with the established cell line ontology from CLO. Our results bridge the gap between cellular line representation and text mining, offering a robust computational model that can significantly impact cancer drug research.

Wireless Communication Technologies for Smart Grid Distribution Networks,"The modernization of the current electric power grid into a smart grid requires the integration of advanced instrumentation, automation, and communication technologies to optimize efficiency, safety, and reliability. In traditional power grids, communication and control tasks are concentrated in substations, limiting their coverage to high-power equipment. As distributed energy resources increase in different sections of the grid, power flow becomes bi-directional. This requires monitoring and control at the Transmission and Distribution (T&D) level, which forms the largest portion of the power grid. To achieve efficient energy flow management and enable consumer participation in demand management, the integration of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is essential. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been identified as a suitable solution for communications within the distribution network. An ongoing challenge, however, is the definition of the best candidates to solve this problem, among the currently available wireless technologies. This paper reviews different wireless communication technologies that provide robustness, reliability, speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness for monitoring distribution lines. An outline of the architecture for smart grid communications, the definition of sensor network requirements for power line environments, and an overview of specific studies focusing on technology comparisons are the main contributions of this paper. The purpose of this review is to delineate current technologies in order to establish potential future research directions within the field.

Visual State Estimation for False Data Injection Detection of Solar Power Generation,"As the penetration level of solar power generation increases in smart cities and microgrids, an automatic energy management system (EMS) without human supervision is most communly deployed. Therefore, assuring safe and reliable data against cyber attacks such as false data injection attacks (FDIAs) has become of utmost importance. To address the aforementioned problem, this paper proposes detecting FDIAs considering visual data. The aim of visual state estimation is to enhance the resilience and security of renewable energy systems. This approach provides an additional layer of defense against cyber attacks, ensuring the integrity and reliability of solar power generation data and facilitating the efficient and secure operation of EMS. The proposed approach uses a modified VGG-16 neural network model to obtain an intermediate representation that provides textual and numerical explanations about the visual weather conditions from sky images. Numerical results and simulations corroborate the validity of our proposed approach. The performance of the modified VGG-16 neural network model is also compared with previous state-of-the-art machine learning models in terms of accuracy.

Novel ideas are proposed to create a new situation and make banks invincible but it is questionable if such innovations necessarily bring competitiveness or business performance. To answer this question, we analyzed market competition using the PR test and data envelopment analysis (DEA) to study the operational efficiency of banks. K-means were also used to segment banks into three groups, Leader, Chaser, and Laggard. The data included financial (business performance) and patent data (innovation) of Taiwan’s banks from 2013 to 2020. The research results revealed that the market competition in the Leader group was the most intense. Quasi-public banks were relatively inefficient in creating revenue, while private banks were more efficient. The Chaser group showed the most apparent changes in operational efficiency from 2013 to 2020. The banks in the Laggard group needed to strengthen the relative efficiency of revenue, and financial innovation needed to be individualized in this competitive market group.

Combined Application of Honokiol and 2-Deoxyglucose against MCF7 Breast Cancer Cells Under Hypoxia,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. Epidemiologists estimate that over 2.3 million new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed worldwide each year. Natural compounds represent promising molecules for the development of antitumor drugs; among them, lignans show significant antiproliferative effects against breast cancer cells. The goal of the study was to analyse the antiproliferative effects of lignan honokiol on MCF7 breast cancer cells, find synergistic combinations of honokiol with 2-deoxyglucose, and evaluate the effects of the combinations found on cells in hypoxia. The antiproliferative effects of the compounds were evaluated by the MTT test, and protein expression analysis was performed by immunoblotting. Honokiol inhibited MCF7 cell growth with an IC50 value of 19.7 μM. Synergistic combinations of honokiol with the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose were detected; the compounds at low doses caused significant suppression of MCF7 cell growth. The established combinations of compounds inhibited HIF-1α expression and were effective in hypoxia, considered as the leading factor of chemotherapeutic resistance. Oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is the main growth driver of hormone-dependent breast tumours. Honokiol combined with 2-deoxyglucose reduced ERα expression in MCF7 cells, and expression of the hormone-dependent protein GREB1 was also downregulated. Honokiol at a concentration of 15 μM in combination with 6 mM 2-deoxyglucose induced the cleavage of PARP (a marker of apoptosis) in MCF7 cells after 48 h of incubation. The cells treated with the combination of honokiol and 2-deoxyglucose demonstrated a decrease in the expression of cyclin D1. Thus, honokiol represents a promising basis for the development of antitumor agents; the combination of this natural compound with glycolysis inhibitors can be used to reduce the applied doses.

Near-Infrared Wavelength Selection and Optimizing Detector Location for Apple Quality Assessment Using Molecular Optical Simulation Environment (MOSE) Software,"As an alternate non-destructive analytical modality for monitoring from pre-harvest to post-storage, optical imaging with near-infrared wavelength is used to forecast the quality of numerous fruits. In the near-infrared spectrum, bio-chemicals are identified and measured with light by penetrating deeply into food components. In addition, apples and other fruits with a high water content benefit from water absorption capabilities. The optical approaches are efficient, inexpensive, and environmentally beneficial. This study is performed to examine the setup of reflection imaging to pick the near-infrared wavelength and optimize the distance between the detector and the light source. Molecular Optical Simulation Environment (MOSE) and Monte Carlo multi-layered programs (MCML) were used to simulate the light propagation in a model of apple tissue to select the appropriate wavelength for evaluating food quality in experiments and optimize the position of the reflected signal receiver. As a consequence, the 700–900 nm wavelength has great promise for use in assessing food quality, particularly apple quality. One centimeter is the optimal distance between the detector and the light source. The data may be used to organize an experiment and create an evaluation tool for determining the quality of fruits using optical methods, particularly apples.

Diagnostic Biomarker for Breast Cancer Applying Rayleigh Low-Rank Embedding Thermography,"Thermography has found extensive application as a supplementary diagnostic tool in breast cancer diagnosis, notably complementing the clinical breast exam (CBE). Within dynamic thermography, matrix factorization methods have demonstrated their utility in accentuating thermal heterogeneities by generating thermal basis vectors. A significant challenge in such approaches is to identify the leading thermal basis vector that effectively captures predominant thermal patterns. Embedding methods are used to fuse multiple projected basis vectors onto a single basis for the extraction of the thermal features, known as thermomics. In this study, we introduce Rayleigh embedding to project thermal basis vectors obtained from factorization techniques into a lower-dimensional space, highlighting thermal patterns. This enhances the reliability of the thermal system, thereby assisting in CBE. The best results of the embedding method combining clinical information and demographics yield 82.9% (66.7%, 86.7%) using a random forest. The results demonstrated promising preliminary outcomes, leading to the early detection of breast abnormalities, and can serve as a non-invasive tool to aid CBE.

The Evaluation of the Rapid Sand Filter Wash Interval at the Central DWTP in the Czech Republic,"This paper evaluates the washing interval of the rapid sand filter at the central drinking water treatment plant Nová Ves—Frýdlant nad Ostravicí in the Czech Republic (DWTP Nová Ves). The aim was to conduct automated flow cytometry measurements (FCM) and find the link between FCM and turbidity. The monitor parameters were the length of the wash cycle in hours, the flow rate of the filter and the production, the pumping of the recirculating wash water, and the physico-chemical and microbial analysis of the water samples. The focus of this paper is the detailed characteristics of the filtration mode evaluated during the summer and winter periods. During the measurements, it was confirmed that turbidity replicated the FCM data measured by the FC BactoSense instrument. Turbidity can be identified as one of the key features that can be related to the measurements made. Turbidity and the cell count itself are influenced, among other things, by the pumping of the return water, whereby an increase in the cell count can be observed after the pumping has stopped but gradually stabilizes at the values measured before pumping.

Prediction and Property Characterization of Injection Machining Parts Using Analysis for Relationship between Melt-Filling Pressure Measurement and Calculation Viscosity Index,"We examine the effects of different process parameter settings on variations in melt-filling pressure, viscosity index, and part weight based on the use of real-time pressure sensor readings of the inside of the injection melt flow path. In the experiment, widely used polypropylene materials and round-shaped molded parts are selected as the molding and study object. At the same time, pressure sensors are used at different positions to perform data acquisition to enable research into the variation process of the melt-filling pressure, allowing for a viscosity index equation to simultaneously calculate viscosity indexes and observe weight variations in the samples. The obtained data will be a basis for setting up smart manufacturing in the future. The research showed the following: (i) the installation of the real-time pressure sensing modules allowed the variation process of the melt-filling pressure to be monitored along a path from the injection barrel to the mold cavity; (ii) the viscosity index was subject to changing the melt temperature, the injection speed, and the V/P switch-over point of the screw; and (iii) the melt temperature change had a considerable impact on part weight and changes in the injection speed had a relatively significant impact on viscosity variation.

With the progress of the social environment, they gradually forgot the traditional agricultural implements that they depended on for a living. Recently, the government has promoted agricultural experience activities, and citizens’ health concept has been improved. Growing vegetables and fruits on farms leads to the concept of shared experience. In particular, technological equipment has become popular. For leisure activities, the public has gradually accepted novel technologies (such as virtual reality games) and integrated them into their usual leisure and entertainment. For this reason, we investigate the degree of virtual interaction with the recall farm as a development basis and use the experiential learning theory to encourage the Silvers to learn the innovative recall farm situation to bring about the effect of leisure and entertainment. The results of this study show that the Silvers experience early agricultural situations and farming implements for entertainment purposes and listen to the agricultural stories to reminisce.

The Development of a High-Concentration Oxygenated Water Generator Based on Nanobubbles and Its Application,"Water with a high concentration of oxygen is needed for the aquaculture industry in Japan. In the current study, the pressurized dissolution method was employed to generate high-concentration oxygenated water (HCOW) by producing oxygen nanobubbles in the water. In order to investigate factors such as temperature, geometric conditions, and their influence on the oxygen concentration, a special nanobubble generator was improved by changing the number and the diameter of the holes of the perforated plate in this study. Then, an experimental system where oxygen and water were separately introduced inside the proposed nanobubble generator was designed. The dissolved oxygen concentration was measured under different conditions. Finally, the produced HCOW was used to cultivate a mini-sunflower. Through a series of experiments, it was found that with the improved perforated plate, the dissolved oxygen concentration was increased and the nanobubble generator reached the saturation state quickly, while the mini-sunflower cultivated with the HCOW appeared to grow larger than that with tap water.

Effects of Face Masks on Respiratory Performance: A Within-Subject Design Study,"There is an ongoing debate about whether wearing a facemask impacts respiratory performance, which is especially crucial in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. This pre- and post-intervention within-subject design study aimed to quantify the impact of wearing a medical facemask during deep breathing on respiratory functions and compare it to deep breathing without a facemask. A total of 100 samples (n = 100) were obtained from a single healthy young male adult (age = 24 years) who underwent pulmonary function measurement before and after 5 min of deep breathing twice a day (morning and night) for 25 days without a facemask, followed by wearing a 4-ply medical face mask for the following 25 days. Significant improvements in all parameters (mean ± SD), including tidal volume (38.04 ± 46.97 mL, p < 0.005), vital capacity (34.08 ± 105.36 mL, p = 0.027), forced vital capacity (0.11 ± 0.11 L, p < 0.005), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (0.13 ± 0.13 L, p < 0.005), peak expiratory flow (0.36 ± 0.74 L/s, p < 0.005), and forced expiratory flow at 25–75% of forced vital capacity (0.04 ± 0.55 L/s, p < 0.005), were found without the facemask, whereas significant an improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (0.05 ± 0.18 L, p = 0.049), a significant reduction in vital capacity (−29.98 ± 103.39 mL, p = 0.046), and no other significant changes were observed with the medical facemask. It was suggested that face masks exert breathing resistance but do not affect deep breathing performance. These results provide further knowledge of the effect of a facemask during deep breathing on respiratory performance.

Identification of Dominant Microbes and Functional Analysis of Sourdough Starters Made of Dried Longan and Raisin,"Baking bread is currently experiencing a profound transformation, propelled by an escalating interest in health and wellness, global cuisines, and sustainability efforts. The surface of fruits harbors various microbes, such as yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (LAB). In contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a commercial yeast, the microbial flora present on the surface of fruits allows bread with greater flavor, texture, and health benefits as seen in sourdough starters. In this research, sourdough starters were created using dried longan and raisin. The microbial flora of the sourdough starters and the fermentation profile were examined, and possible bacteriocin genes were identified. The dried longan starter exhibited bubbling, stickiness, and a drop in pH value from 5.80 to 4.45 at the third day of fermentation. Meanwhile, the raisin starter began bubbling on the sixth day with no change in fluid viscosity, and a small pH value decreased from 4.00 to 3.82. The dried longan starter contained Weissella cibaria, W. paramesenteroides, S. cerevisiae, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Torulaspora delbrueckii and Leuconostoc citreum. On the other hand, raisin starter only contained Candida krusei and T. delbrueckii. To detect antibacterial property in W. paramesenteroides and P. pentosaceus, four bacteriocins, Gassericin A (gaaA), Lactacin F (lafA), Plantaricin S (pls) and Pediocin (ped) were explored. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results revealed that gaaA and lafA were present in W. paramesenteroides, which suggested that this strain possessed antimicrobial properties.

IoT + DBMS = Periodic Summary of the Health Status of Remote Patients,"There is a growing number of frail patients whose health conditions require constant monitoring by physicians. Unfortunately, the budget restrictions of hospitals and the concomitant decision that patients should stay home require that this monitoring is to be carried out remotely. Today, Internet of Things (IoT) wearables are the most promising technology solution for sensing patients’ physiological values 24/7. These measurements need to be stored permanently and then processed in order to provide support to physicians in charge of making real-time clinical decisions consistent with the patient’s health status. This paper elaborates on the combination of the IoT and DBMS technologies. In detail, a PostgreSQL relational database stores patient-generated health data (PGHD), while a set of SQL views generates standard summary statistical indicators.

Evaluating Stresses in SiO2 Thin Films Using Molecular Dynamics Simulations,"Semiconductor electronics is transforming computing, communication, energy harvesting, automobiles, biotechnology, and other electronic device landscapes. This transformation has been brought about by the ability to sense, receive, manipulate, and transmit data from the diverse systems of vertical stacks of semiconductor layers and microdevices. Though the discrete design details of each semiconductor may be extremely complex, the fundamental processing steps of each semiconductor device align well with the photolithography procedure. When these semiconductor layers are stacked using photolithography, the signal noise between the device features and layers is restricted by passivation or dielectric insulation provided by SiO2 layers. Depending on the type of functionality and the data-sensing mechanism of the semiconductors used, SiO2 layers have an intended fitness for their purpose. The purpose of SiO2 layers can be summarized as the encapsulation of the semiconductor device, making part of the semiconductor layer inert, i.e., passivated, creating a hard mask to negate the impact of subsequent processes like ion implantation or diffusion, insulating a part of the layer as in an intermetallic dielectric or gate dielectric, and improving adhesion of the subsequent deposition. The functionality of the adhesion of SiO2 is by far a less-studied area. The adhesive characteristics of SiO2 for subsequent deposition and the thickness of SiO2 affect stress distribution. Stresses due to SiO2 thin films, which can range from a few nanometers to a few microns thick depending on the functionality, are modeled in this research. The stresses in SiO2 films may cause delamination or discontinuity, affecting the performance and reliability of the optical or semiconductor devices they are built into. The classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation technique was employed to investigate the stress characteristics of deposited films by leveraging the outcomes of atomistic modeling. A cluster made of fused silica was employed as a substrate. For the simulation of the SiO2 deposition process, silicon atoms with high energies and low-energy oxygen atoms were injected. This model was carefully controlled to ensure the stoichiometric conditions. In this analysis, we used the open-source code LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) and the Ovito (Open Visualization) tool. The research in this paper focuses on SiO2 thin-film simulation to validate analytical and experimental stress.

Neonatal Activity Monitoring by Camera-Based Multi-LSTM Network,"The objective evaluation of an infant’s activity and sleep pattern is critical in improving the comfort of the babies and ensuring the proper amount of quality sleep. The predefined behavioral states of an infant describe their consciousness and arousal level. The different states are characterized by different movements, body tone, eye movements and breath patterns. To recognize and adapt to these states is an essential part of development-friendly caring. It affects the neonate’s sleep, influencing their brain development, while improving the bonding between mother and baby, and feeding is more successful during the state of quiet awakened. It can be a more difficult task to determine the level of arousal in premature neonates. In preterm clinics, the general practice is continuous observation, requiring the attention of the hospital staff. To create an automated, more objective system, helping the hospital staff and the parents, we developed a multi-RNN (multi-recurrent neural network) network-based solution to solve this classification problem, which works on a time-series-like feature set, extracted from cameras’ video feeds. The set is composed of video actigraphy features, video-based respiration signal and additional descriptors. We separate infant caring from undisturbed presence based on our previous ensemble network solution. The network was trained and evaluated using our database of 402 h of footage, collected at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Dept. of Neonatology of Pediatrics, Dept. of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary, with all-day recordings of 10 babies.

Lightweight Network for Single Image Super-Resolution with Arbitrary Scale Factor,"The existing single image super-resolution (SISR) methods that consider integer scale factors (X2, X3, X4, and X8), have been developed well, but SISR methods with arbitrary scale factors (X1.3, X2.5, and X3.7) have gradually gained attention recently. Therefore, we proposed an efficient, lightweight model. In this study, there are two contributions as follows. (1) An efficient and lightweight network for SISR is combined with the up-scaled module, which determines its weights based on the size of the high-resolution (HR) image. (2) All scale factors are applied simultaneously using one model, which saves more storage and computational resources. Finally, we design various experiments to evaluate the proposed method based on multiple general datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed model is lightweight while the performance is relatively competitive.

Defect Detection by Analyzing Thermal Infrared Images Covered with Shadows with a Hybrid Approach Driven by Local and Global Intensity Fitting Energy,"Defect detection using thermal infrared images is used in nondestructive evaluation and testing because it is easy to use. Thermal infrared images recorded the surface temperatures of the target with a thermal infrared camera. Image segmentation is a technique to group those pixels with similar surface temperatures to form thermal patterns. Defects can be identified by the segmented patterns having different surface temperatures in their neighborhoods. In this study, a hybrid approach combining fitting energy is proposed for describing the contamination illustrated in the recorded surface temperatures and regional constants averaging the surface temperatures of the segmented regions. The numerical implementation is completed by applying the level set functions on an iteration scheme. The initial level sets evolve till a convergence can be reached. The processed results demonstrate that the hybrid approach can be used for defect detection.

"Willingness, Proficiency, or Supports? Challenges in Implementing Content and Language Integrated Learning for Taiwan K-12 Teachers","After the Taiwanese government launched the Blueprint for Developing Taiwan into a Bilingual Nation by 2030, the Implementation Project of Bilingual Instruction in several domains of primary and junior high school education was promoted by the Taiwan Ministry of Education. Content and language integrated learning (CLIL) is a dual-objective strategy in which students simultaneously acquire language skills and subject knowledge. CLIL has been widely implemented and proven to be successful in European countries. This strategy will become the primary method of bilingual education for instructors in grades K-12. Other non-European countries, such as Latin America and Indonesia, however, found difficulties applying CLIL in class. The issues need to be identified to encourage researchers and practitioners to find solutions. The purpose of this paper is to identify the barriers to implementing CLIL from the perspective of K-12 teachers. We surveyed 102 K-12 teachers in Keelung using a questionnaire. The findings indicate that (1) 49.0% of teachers feel concerned if they are required to teach half of their content in English, (2) 64.8% of teachers are willing to improve their English proficiency in their spare time for implementing CLIL in class, and (3) only 36.3% of teachers are willing to adopt CLIL in class, while 50.0% of teachers are willing to implement CLIL if a teaching assistant system supports them with English course materials. Teaching assistant systems that provide English course materials might influence teachers’ willingness to implement CLIL in class.

An Analysis of Visitors’ Perceptions of Shopping Malls,"Shopping malls have been a significant part of our daily lives for decades. Their significance is derived from the use of these spaces based on great numbers of people, as well as the role malls play in culture. On the other hand, the design of malls has been constantly evolving according to the needs of users and the market. This study is based on survey data that we collected from ninety visitors of a shopping mall located in Izmir, Turkiye. Through the survey, we collected data on topics such as the participants’ visit frequency and reasons for visiting the mall, architectural and spatial features they favor and/or dislike, their opinions on where they perceive malls in everyday life, and their opinions on alternative spaces to malls. The data collection was finalized right before the pandemic, which significantly changed the way we think about public spaces, as well as malls, in relation to architecture. Analyzing collected data provides further insight into surveyed customers’ perception of spaces, the design of shopping malls, the use of the space, the preferred design features, as well as design features that drive customers away from the mall. The analysis was later compared and linked to studies in the literature. These research findings have the potential to be used in studies that evaluate mall design and space use, as well as in studies that compare the post-pandemic perception of spaces and the use of shopping malls.

Turning Waste into Soil Conditioner with a Sustainable Innovative Approach: Biochar,"Globally, the increase in population density, various epidemics (COVID-19, SARS, MERS, etc.), climate change, global warming, and the reduction of arable land have caused damage to the ecosystem. Quality soil is the most important factor that has a direct impact on safe food and a clean environment. Different pollutant loads, microbiological activities, climatic and topographic conditions, and current land use can change the properties of the soil. In recent years, fertile agricultural lands have been used in the construction industry. This situation explains the inadequacy between population growth and food supply. Both polluting parameters and non-purpose uses negatively affect soil quality, and alternative solutions are sought for this. One of these solutions is the application of various additives to the soil. Among these substances, biochar is a widely used additive in agricultural production, soil quality improvement, and pollutant treatment in water and soil environments. It is a carbon-rich product formed by the pyrolysis method of biochar, food, and agricultural wastes in an oxygen-free environment at ≥250 °C. In this study, current research is examined to explain the interaction of soil quality with biochar. The biochar materials used, the production conditions, and the three-step reaction in the soil were examined. This study summarizes the recent developments in the soil quality of biochar with a porous structure and high specific surface area.

Therefore, detection at an early stage is crucial for reducing the mortality rate linked to this disease. Mammography is the primary screening method for breast cancer. However, it has drawbacks, including high rates of false-positive and negative results, inter-observer variability, and limited sensitivity with dense breast tissue. To solve such problems, breast cancer was analyzed and classified using mammography images and deep learning models from the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) database. This database contains processed and raw images from the RSNA that consist of annotated malignancies and clinical data. Using deep learning models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) models such as visual geometry group (VGG), Googlenet, EfficientNet, and Residual Networks, mammograms were classified into cancer or non-cancer categories. In this study, a novel architecture was proposed by combining CNNs and attention mechanisms, which extracted and highlighted the relevant features. A dataset of 8000 patients with 47,000 photographs was used to train and assess the model via 5-fold cross-validation. The results outperformed prior methods using the same database and reached an average accuracy rate of 95%. The results showed that mammography with deep learning methods considerably improved breast cancer detection and diagnosis.

The Impact of Anthropogenic Activity on the Quality of Bottom Sediments in the Watershed of the Delňa Creek,"This paper is focused on evaluating the quality of bottom sediments and water in the watershed of the Delňa creek, where gold, antimony and mercury were mined in the past. The results showed that the biggest source of pollution was a heap of mining material, where the limit values of Sb, As, Hg and Pb concentrations in the sediments were exceeded. Other sources of pollution in the river basin were the right-hand tributaries. A comparison of the dependencies of the concentrations of potentially toxic metals in the water and sediments shows that while the concentrations of pollutants in the waters react to the current state of water quality in the basin and tributaries (pH, concentration, discharge), the sediments exhibit a stable concentration character.

Inhibitory Effects of 5-Fluorouracil on the Growth of 4-Hydroxytamoxifen-Resistant and Sensitive Breast Cancer Cells,"Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for about 10 million deaths a year, or nearly one in six deaths. The most common types of cancer are breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers. Prolonged application of hormone drugs leads to the development of resistance. The development of agents with high activity against resistant cells is a challenge. It is important to create novel targeted compounds and search for active molecules among those previously developed. The study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of 4-hydroxytamoxifen-resistant cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and analyse the signalling pathways that are regulated by 5-FU in breast cancer cells. Antiproliferative activity of compounds was assessed by the MTT assay, and immunoblotting was used to evaluate the expression of proteins in breast cancer cells. Activity of 5-FU was evaluated on parental MCF7 cells and a cell subline with resistance to 4-hydroxytamoxifen (HT), named MCF7/HT. The MCF7/HT cells showed high sensitivity to 5-FU. Expression of oestrogen receptor α (ERα, a key driver of breast cancer growth) in MCF7 and MCF7/HT cells was not sensitive to 5-FU treatment. In both parental and resistant cells, 5-FU induced changes in the activity of several signalling proteins. 5-FU activated AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) and upregulated cyclin D1 expression. The data suggest that 5-FU should be further investigated as a chemotherapeutic for hormone-resistant cancers; the combination of 5-FU with novel apoptosis inducer LCTA-3344 is considered effective to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells, including those that are hormone-resistant.

Using Ultrawideband Technology to Control a Car to Reach Its Destination,"This paper presents a method that enables a small car to reach its destination in an indoor environment using ultrawideband technology. For this purpose, we used four anchors and one tag. The tag can move because it is fixed on the car. The anchors and the tag are DWM1001 modules. The configuration of the five DW1001 modules is performed through a smartphone application provided by the manufacturer. The car has been built by us. The controller of the car is a Raspberry Pi microcomputer which controls the driver of the car DC motors by generating PWM signals. In addition, Raspberry Pi communicates with the tag by the UART interface. Thus, our goal was to control the car to reach a certain destination (xd, yd) requested by the user via Wi-Fi. Because the car hosts the tag, it continuously updates its position according to the information received from the four anchors. We implemented two scenarios, considering the initial (x, y) position of the car. In the first scenario, which is simpler, the car moved to its destination either along the x-axis or along the y-axis. In the second scenario, the car moves along one of the axes and then turns 90 degrees to reach its destination. Experimental results that show the precision of the positioning system are presented.

Design Styles and Restoration of Traditional Residential Buildings in Northern China,"The development of Chinese ancient architectural design has gone through three historical stages: primitive society, slave society, and feudal society. Due to the influence of geography, the environment, and the humanities, the regional architectural styles of each region were also formed. In particular, this is reflected in the residential architecture. Among residential architectures, the courtyard architectural style is the most typical, adapting to the microclimate and improving the comfort of living. This enclosed style of architecture was accompanied by the diffusion of Chinese culture and enriched the architectural design of the East Asian region. Nonetheless, as urbanisation accelerated, this traditional style of architecture began to be undermined. In addition, there is less discussion of the architectural content that embodies design ideas in terms of ritual, order, form, components, and color. In order to preserve this precious built environment, this study highlights the design style and its connotations. Through the use of case studies, the stylistic characteristics of a traditional dwelling in Northern China and the restoration process are assessed. Furthermore, observations on key building components, construction techniques, and materials are made in terms of architectural ideas. This leads to the proposition that conservation strategies should be appropriate to local conditions. The findings show that building restoration can contribute to the effective conservation of traditional building forms and provide an opportunity to inherit traditional culture. Moreover, it is more conducive to the presence of Chinese residential architecture that shines in the world discourse. New perspectives and contributions are offered in the fields of architectural design and conservation.

An Investigation of Shopping Mall Design Requirements,"Shopping malls may be considered as controversial structures since they sometimes fail to comply with the expectations of the project stakeholders throughout the project life cycle. New mall projects often attract the attention of people since such a structure has a potential to reshape the neighborhood it is located in; however, the impact is usually negative. On the other hand, the parties involved in mall projects may be subject to criticism from both the public and the industry during the design, construction, and operation. In this study we conducted semi-structured interviews with five managers of an international company that provides real estate services worldwide, and mainly focuses on managing shopping centers within the context of Turkiye. During the interviews, we collected insights on shopping mall design and criteria that have an impact on the operational success or failure. We analyzed the interview data to understand the shopping mall design requirements from the experts’ perspectives. We summarized our investigation under three main categories as location, shop and brand mix, and design. Analyzed data indicates that the requirements and use of shopping malls evolve and change over time. The change is driven by things such as changing habits and expectations of the users and new marketing approaches. Understanding such changes is essential for designers and investors to propose new design approaches and space compositions in order to be able to adapt to the changes. Through our analysis of the collected data, we provided insights on requirements and new trends that affect the design of malls. As further explained in this paper, our analysis indicates a number of important topics during design such as the need to design to fit ever-changing spatial needs, providing feel-good environment for users, correct placement of spaces and stores related to each other, designing circulation that supports commercial activities, and designing with a consideration of operation and maintenance. According to the collected data, the trend of shopping mall design is towards integration of hybrid uses, free forms, more open spaces, increased emphasis on gastronomy, and enabling socializing while leveraging technology and being more sustainable.

A Compartment Pharmacokinetics Model of THC and Its Metabolites after Smoking,"This article presents the application of the compartment model to investigate the pharmacokinetics of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), one of the cannabinoids found in cannabis, after smoking cannabis. The behavior of THC and its metabolite concentrations in the body following smoking were investigated, and the result offered a guideline for determining the appropriate duration between each smoking session to prevent intoxication and potential harm to the body. The compartment model was transformed into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the rate of change in the concentration of THC and its metabolites in each compartment, employing the law of mass action. For simulating the solution curve, the exact solutions of the ODE system and an actual data sample were processed using Microsoft Excel to obtain the optimal rate constants using curve fitting and generating a simulated curve that closely matched the actual data. The findings in this study indicated that the proposed model effectively described the concentration behavior of THC and its metabolites in plasma and other tissues. Therefore, the model will serve as a valuable tool for the determination of the appropriate duration between each smoking session to prevent harm to the body.

Fluvial Flood Risk in Contemporary Settlements: A Case of Vadodara City in the Vishwamitri Watershed,"Settlements situated downstream of hills and dams are invariably at risk of floods. Constant land use/land cover changes in the Vishwamitri Watershed and long-term climate variability have made Vadodara City more susceptible to river flooding in recent times. In the past, the local government authorities have only tried to solve this issue within the administrative boundary of the Vadodara City. This study demonstrates the importance of watershed scale investigation over administrative scale. The study presents a review of the current flooding and environmental degradation challenges that are affecting the Vishwamitri Watershed. For the analysis, the entire watershed was classified into two parts: (1) the upper watershed and (2) city limits. The data-deficient upper watershed was studied with the aid of site visits and secondary sources. The floodplain within the city limits was simulated for the 2005 peak discharge event (805 cumec) using Hydrological Engineering Centre—River Analysis System (HEC-RAS, 5.0.7.) software and HEC-GeoRAS (10.2.) (a set of procedures, tools, and utilities for processing geospatial data in ArcGIS using a graphical user interface). The simulated water surface elevation from HEC-RAS was validated with the in situ data available within the city limits. The generated floodplain extent map was used for conducting a primary flood impact survey and analysing the inundation-affected zones. Various aspects of the flood plain, like land use, land cover, built form, affected demography, river system, natural environment and habitat, were analysed during this survey. For the mitigation of floods and other maladies associated with the watershed, this probing calls for the restoration of the river ecosystem back to its original state to the maximum possible extent. Nature-based solutions were found to be the remedy for most of the issues pertaining to the floodplain. The study can potentially help concerned stakeholders of any flood-prone urban settlement to envision the issue of flooding with the whole river system and watershed in mind. This will discourage the usual approach of interventions limited to administrative boundaries.

Comparative Analysis of Digital Contact-Tracing Technologies for Informing Public Health Policies,"Contact tracing is the cornerstone of epidemic control of infectious diseases, especially in the era of COVID-19. This labor-intensive task calls for the use of digital technology to help identify individuals who have potentially been exposed to the infection to deliver necessary interventions and treatment. Mobile applications based on different technologies and system architectures have been developed and widely used in concert with public health policies and regulations. Three main types of digital contact-tracing technologies, namely Bluetooth low energy (BLE), location tracking, and check-in, were adopted in contact-tracing apps and implemented with a centralized or decentralized system architecture to protect privacy and facilitate spatiotemporal co-occurrence matching. Passive data collection methods, including BLE and location tracking, could be contrasted with check-in-based apps, which require users’ effort to record their whereabouts. Persuasive computing with a centralized system for collecting contact-tracing data from users might require additional legislation for authorization and privacy protection. Technology options should therefore be taken into account when designing enforceable public health policies on the use of contact-tracing apps. At the same time, public health policies also inform the information system’s design. This paper aims to delineate and contrast current technologies and system architectures used for developing contact-tracing apps and examine the intertwined relationship between the design and implementation of public health policies and the design of digital contact-tracing systems.

Anomaly Detection on Network Traffic for the Healthcare Internet of Things,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized technologies in society, including in households, offices, factories, and health centers. Among these, the Healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT) significantly transforms medical assistance for patients. By using wearable devices with remote network connections, caregivers monitor patients’ physiological data to gain valuable insights into their health conditions. Despite the many benefits of the HIoT, several security vulnerabilities still exist. Hackers can exploit the internet connection to steal or modify credential information regarding patients, violating the integrity and confidentiality of the security policy. Moreover, they can launch cyberattacks on hospitals or critical life-support systems, further endangering patients’ lives. Consequently, it is crucial to implement robust cybersecurity measures to enhance the security of healthcare services. Therefore, we proposed an anomaly detection method based on network traffic for the HIoT, adopting Markov models. Owing to their simplicity, interpretability, and well-developed theory, the Markov models have been applied to network traffic prediction and modeling, serving as a viable approach to cater to our needs. We evaluated the proposed method using the public dataset ToN_IoT and analyzed the results.

Acoustic Cavitation and Ionic Liquid Combined: A Modeling Investigation of the Possible Promises in Terms of Physico-Chemical Effects,"The present work is based on a mathematical model describing a single acoustic cavitation bubble oscillating under an ultrasonic field of 200 and 300 kHz and an acoustic amplitude of 1.8 atm within 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. The model integrates the dynamics of bubble oscillation, the thermodynamics applied to the interior of the bubble and at its interface, and the sonophysical and sonochemical events occurring in the presence of dissolved cellulose in the ionic liquid. The performed simulations shed light on the major physical effects of acoustic cavitation, namely the shockwave and microjet, as well as the sonochemical effects in terms of the degradation rate of the dissolved cellulose in the secondary reactional site, i.e., the interface. The predominance of the effects and its dependency of the acoustic frequency is tackled from an energetic point of view. It is demonstrated that 300 kHz offers the lowest heat flow across the bubble interface, lowering the chances for the sonochemical degradation of cellulose, while 200 kHz offers a significant degradation rate, attaining 71.4 mol·dm−3·s−1, as well as harsher microjets and shockwaves with powers of 3300 and 900 mW at collapse, respectively.

The Odd Beta Prime Inverted Kumaraswamy Distribution with Application to COVID-19 Mortality Rate in Italy,"Inverted distributions, also known as inverse distributions, are essential statistical models for analyzing real-life data in biomedical sciences, engineering, and other fields. In this paper, we use the odd beta prime-G family and the inverted Kumaraswamy distribution to introduce a new inverted distribution called the odd beta prime inverted Kumaraswamy. The new distribution exhibits right-skewed, J-shaped densities and features increasing-constant, concave-convex, and bathtub hazard functions. Some of its statistical properties are explored. The parameters are estimated via the maximum likelihood method. The empirical importance of the new model is proved through its application to COVID-19 mortality data from Italy. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms its competitors. We hope that this proposed distribution can be considered as a viable alternative to some well-established distributions for modeling real-life data across various application areas.

Unveiling Mobilizable Multiresistance Clusters in Marine Bacteria,"The occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance have become a pressing global health concern. Understanding the genetic elements that facilitate the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in marine environments is crucial for effective microbial surveillance and management strategies. This study aimed to reveal the presence of mobilizable multiresistance clusters, consisting of ARGs associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs), in marine bacterial communities. Water samples were collected from two beaches in Jeju, South Korea, and screened to identify multi-drug resistant bacteria. A total of 20 bacterial isolates were selected for whole genome sequencing, and through comprehensive genomic analysis, we identified and characterized nine such clusters primarily composed of betalactams, aminoglycosides, and tetracycline ARGs associated with MGEs like IS6, IS9, and Tn3. Additionally, an extensive analysis of 900 marine bacterial genomes from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database was conducted to gain a broader perspective. Our results provide valuable insights into the prevalence and diversity of mobilizable multiresistance clusters in marine bacterial communities.

Design of Photonic Crystal Fiber for 5G Communication Using COMSOL Multiphysics,"Photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) have emerged as promising candidates for enabling high-performance 5G communication systems, attributed to their low loss and wide bandwidth characteristics. In this research, we leverage the capabilities of COMSOL Multiphysics v5.6 software to meticulously design a novel photonic crystal fiber (PCF) design based on Topas, featuring a rectangular air gap core with integrated slots, surrounded by a cladding composed of circular and octagon air holes. The circular air holes are arranged in square and octagon lattice structures, while the octagon air holes form a rhombic lattice. The proposed structure exhibits a high birefringence of 0.05 and low effective material loss (EML) of 0.059 cm−1 and 0.057 cm−1 at 2 THz for x and y polarization mode, respectively. Moreover, the proposed waveguide also has a low confinement loss of 10−10 and 10−11 cm−1 for x and y polarization mode. Thus, the proposed PCF structure exhibits significant potential for facilitating 5G requirements.

Metal phosphide catalysts are promising alternatives to conventional metal catalysts due to their unique reactivity and stability. Here, we used DFT to study the catalytic performance of Ni2P catalysts doped with Fe and Ru for ammonia synthesis. We show that H-assisted N–N activation may provide a new route to circumvent the N2 dissociation scaling relationships.

The Detection of Moisture Content and the Delamination of Thermally Modified Woods Based on Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy,"As commonly used materials in building and interior furniture decoration, wood materials should be processed via the pyrolysis technique in order to improve their corrosion resistance, flame retardancy, and dimensional stability. However, during the process of pyrolysis, temperature and time are significant factors for avoiding internal damage. The main reason comes from the decrease in internal structural water. Existing non-destructive evaluation methods have difficulty detecting moisture content and delamination within wood due to its complex internal structure. In this work, a novel image processing method is proposed to detect the delamination of wood materials. The results show that, compared to spruce and oak, meranti is more resistant to pyrolysis and has a higher structural stability.

A Data Envelopment Analysis to Benchmark Hotel Energy Consumption in an Urban Locality,"The benchmarking of hotel energy use comprehensively identifies the controllable and uncontrollable factors affecting energy performance, including building characteristics, management strategies, operations, and maintenance systems. Other factors include climatic conditions, floor areas, operating hours, occupancy rates, and guest populations. A benchmarking study on energy consumption patterns in significant hotels (each with less than 100 rooms and an average staff strength of 40 employees), situated in the university town of Nsukka (longitude 70 23′ E, latitude 60 52′ N), Nigeria, was performed using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology. The DEA, a linear programming technique that measures the relative performances of units, was chosen as a benchmarking methodology due to its ability to handle multiple inputs and outputs. Following a correlation test, energy use intensity, diesel consumption, and the number of employees were selected as the analysis inputs, while the occupancy rate was chosen as the output variable. Data on these variables spanning 12 months were collected using questionnaires, interviews, site visits, and oral conversations with hotel managers to ensure validity. Grid-supplied electricity accounted for most of the hotels’ energy needs, followed by diesel used in generators. More than 70% of the electricity use was for HVAC. From the DEA, Hotel 3 (DMU H3) had a technical efficiency score of 1, whereas adjustments were recommended for improving the efficiency scores of the other hotels, which were deemed inefficient. DMU H7 had the lowest efficiency score (0.474) and the highest identified savings for electricity and diesel. The analysis also revealed that occupancy rates were generally low in the months of June and July, coinciding with the high rainfall season with its accompanying decline in outdoor activities. Consistent with this, electricity consumption was highest in the Christmas and Easter holiday months of December, January, and April following increased travel-related activities.

Novel Dispersion of CeO2 Nanofiller in PEO/PMMA Blended Nanocomposite Solid Polymer Electrolytes,"The present study focuses on the electrochemical performance of polyethylene oxide (PEO)-polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blended plasticized nanocomposite solid polymer electrolytes (BPNSPEs) amid cadmium bromide (CdBr2) as a dopant salt along with a cerium oxide (CeO2) nanofiller. Incredibly thin nanofilms of BPNSPE were signalized through distinct methods of working in characterization studies, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and scanning electron micrography (SEM). The X-ray diffractograms (XRDs) confirmed the formation of the polymer electrolyte (PE) as well as a decrease in the degree of crystalline characteristics in the BPNSPE sample, and the particle dimension was calculated via the Debye–Scherer equation. The structural changes and formation of complexes were inspected by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and ocular absorbance scrutiny was accomplished by ultraviolet visible spectroscopy, whereas the morphological structure was interpreted by scanning electron microg-graphical images. The existing work is intended to increase the awareness of the significance of CeO2 nanofillers with the BPNSPE arrangement, which is suitable for batteries and ionic devices.

Biotechnological Solutions for Recycling Synthetic Fibers,"Biotechnology offers the potential for selective depolymerization of natural and synthetic fibers, isolation of components, or recovery of monomers. This progress solves the problems associated with the regeneration of monomers from synthetic fiber blends, especially when contaminated or mixed fibers are involved. In addition, the recycling of used fiber products into higher-value products not only keeps waste out of landfills but also creates economic opportunities and reduces the need to produce new synthetic fibers. Synthetic fibers can be recovered by mechanical or chemical recycling, but biotechnological solutions with enzymes offer a more environmentally friendly alternative to harsh chemicals by selectively breaking down certain chemical bonds in polymers to obtain purer monomeric building blocks. Efficient biotechnological recycling, however, depends on the specific polymer, as different enzymes, microbial colonies, fungal hyphae, etc. can process different man-made fibers. Challenges arise with any type of fiber recovery, including enzymatic degradation when suitable enzymes have not yet been discovered or when fiber blends impede accessibility and efficiency. This short review provides an overview of the possibilities of biotechnological solutions for synthetic fiber recovery.

An Approach to the Assessment of the Physical Stability of Mayonnaises,"A significant number of foods are manufactured in the form of emulsions. A typical example of such a product is mayonnaises, which vary in oil content. However, as a macroemulsion, they are a thermodynamically unstable system. Therefore, the physical instability associated with processes such as flocculation, coalescence and Ostwald ripening leads to separation of the oil and water phases over time. This is especially typical of low-fat mayonnaises. As the oil content in the sauce decreases, it is necessary to add various biopolymers to ensure its stability over time. Predicting physical instability is important for food technology development purposes, and especially for reduced oil systems as the most challenging task in terms of system stabilization. In the first approximation according to the Stoke’s model, the stability of an emulsion is affected by microstructural characteristics such as as the droplet size and the rheological properties of the emulsions. The combination of this approximation with the generalized Casson’s rheological model for structured liquid systems allows us to propose an approach for estimating the rate of emulsion creaming. The parameters used for calculations are determined from rheology and laser diffraction data for mayonnaise samples. The approach is devoid of empirical variables, since all parameters have a physical meaning on the basis of the kinetic model of destruction–recovery of the structural aggregates of the system. Calculations were carried out for a series of commercial mayonnaises (CMs) and developed low-fat mayonnaise (LFM). The results make it possible to evaluate the physical stability of emulsions, as well as the influence of rheological and microstructural characteristics on the texture of the final product during its shelf life.

Multipurpose Smart Shoe for Various Communities,"A recent survey depicts that across the globe there are nearly 36 million visually impaired people facing serious issues in accessibility, education, navigating public spaces, safety concerns, and mental health. In recent times, the evolutions of obstacle detectors for blind people have been from peoples’ use of sticks, smart glasses, and smart shoes. Among the above, the major problem faced by all blind people is to walk independently to every place, so to make them feel independent while they walk, herein is a proposal for an intelligent shoe. The proposed intelligent shoe consists of a controller connected with an ultrasonic sensor, voice alert system (VAS), vibration patterns, GPS navigation, connectivity with a smart phone or smart-watch, voice assistance, feedback on gait and posture, and emergency features that are embedded with each other to communicate the presence of obstacles in the directions of the path of the blind. The sensor identifies an obstacle in the direction present then it passes the signal to the controller that activates the VAS and the vibration patterns present in that direction. Therefore, by the proposed concept of vibration sense and VAS with GPS navigation, connectivity with a smart phone or smart-watch means the system provides easy access for the blind to identify obstacles present in their way and help them toward social inclusion.

Numerical Investigation of Crack Mitigation in Tubular KT-Joints Using Composite Reinforcement,"Recently, fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) have begun to be used for steel structure reinforcement, following decades of successful utilization for the reinforcement of concrete structures. However, rehabilitation of tubular joints with a crack at the interface of mating members using FRP has rarely been investigated. A tubular KT-joint having a semi-elliptical crack subjected to axial tensile load is explored in this study. The joint was simulated using the fracture tool of ANSYS Structural, and the effect of crack size, location, and FRP reinforcement on stress intensity factor (SIF) was evaluated. The numerical simulations show that FRP reinforcement reduces the SIF, decreases the likelihood of crack growth, and may increase the fatigue life. A 4–12% reduction per millimeter thickness of unidirectional FRP was recorded.

Multi-Dimensional Energy Management Based on an Optimal Allocation of Hybrid Wind Turbine Distributed Generation and Battery Energy Storage System in a Flexible Interconnected Distribution Network Considering Seasonal Uncertainties,"In recent years, the incorporation of wind turbine distributed generation (WTDG) in addition to a battery energy storage system (BESS) into an electrical distribution network (EDN) has developed into a beneficial solution for ensuring a satisfying balance between energy generation and consumption. The principal approaches used to locate and size multiple WTDG and BESS units inside an EDN are described in this article. To optimize overall multi-objective functions, this research investigates the optimal planning of multiple hybrid WTDG and BESS units in an EDN. In the first scenario, injecting active power into the EDN is accomplished by installing WTDG. In contrast, in the second scenario, hybrid WTDG and BESS units are deployed concurrently to provide the EDN, taking into consideration the seasonal uncertainty of load–source power variation in order to approach the practical case, where there are many parameters to be optimized, considering different constraints, during the uncertain times and variable data of a load and power generator. The suggested work’s originality is in completely designing a novel multi-objective function (MOF) based on the sum of three technical metrics of the active power loss (APL), voltage deviation (VD), and operating time of the overcurrent relay (OTR). The proposed MOF is validated on the standard IEEE 69-bus distribution network by applying a new, recently published meta-heuristic algorithm called the Light Spectrum Optimizer (LSO) algorithm. The optimized outcomes revealed that the LSO showed good behavior in minimizing each parameter included in the MOF during the year season.

Evaluation of the Potential of Microalgae as Bioremediation Agents for Olive Mill Wastewater,"The potential for bioremediation of olive mill wastewaters with different origins—olive washing (OWW) and olive oil extraction (OMW)—among four species of microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris, Auxenochlorella protothecoides, Scenedesmus obliquus, and Arthrospira maxima) was evaluated. All microalgae could grow in the wastewaters, but C. vulgaris and C. protothecoides showed the best performances. The highest biomass productivities of 165.8 mg L−1 day−1 for OMW and 107.9 mg L−1 day−1 for OWW were achieved with C. vulgaris and A. protothecoides, respectively. Moreover, with both species, COD and nitrate contents of the two wastewaters were reduced by 60 and more than 50%, respectively. However, significant removal of polyphenols was verified only in OWW (~45%). Overall, these findings demonstrate the potential of C. vulgaris and A. protothecoides species to be used in a biological olive mill wastewater treatment process.

Canned Beans Aquafaba as an Egg White Substitute in the Technology of Low-Fat Mayonnaise,"Global trends of promoting a healthy lifestyle through a balanced diet and reducing the consumption of animal products and high-fat-content foods have contributed to the creation of new mayonnaise-like products. The aim of the study was to develop a technology for low-fat mayonnaise containing 30% sunflower oil. Canned white bean aquafaba was used as a plant-based emulsifier to create an egg-free sauce. To maintain the texture and rheological properties of the food emulsion, a water-soluble polymer such as carboxymethylcellulose was used as a thickener and a pectin–xanthan mixture was used as a gelling agent. The ratio of the main ingredients of the emulsion emulsifier/stabilizer/thickener was 3:0.7:0.3 (%). The prepared emulsion-like sauce was characterized by high sedimentation stability at the level of 98%, as well as acidity equal to 0.691 g of acetic acid equivalent per 100 g sample and pH = 3.66. The volume droplet size distribution had a mean particle size of 8.4 μm and a SPAN factor of 1.7 µm, indicating typical values for these parameters of a well-homogenized mayonnaise-like emulsion. Rheological studies made it possible to classify the samples as viscoelastic systems with a pseudoplastic flow pattern and a sufficiently high yield shear stress value equal to 132 Pa as a quantitative parameter confirming the stability of the microstructure over time. Sensory analysis confirmed high scores for consistency, taste and smell of the end-product.

Oxidative Grafting of Adrenaline onto Carbon Electrode Surface: Preliminary Studies,"In the present work, we performed the optimization of electrografting of adrenaline onto a glassy carbon electrode surface. The cyclic voltammetry technique was used to immobilize the compound on the electrode surface by immersing it in an acidic adrenaline solution. This grafting was achieved by conducting 20 successive CV scans over a wide potential range. The stability of the obtained layer was analyzed using the SWV technique. The conducted research shows that it is possible to create a stable adrenaline layer on the GCE surface using voltammetric techniques. Additionally, once a stable layer was immobilized, its sensitivity to certain metal cations—which cannot be directly detected electrochemically—was verified. After exposing the sensor to designated cationic solutions, there was a significant decrease in the adrenaline signal. This suggests potential future applications in cation determination.

It is assumed that predators consume susceptible and infected prey and that infected prey consumes susceptible prey. We consider the effect of fear on susceptible prey due to the predator species. Furthermore, the predator consumes its prey in the form of Holling-type and Crowley–Martin-type interactions. Also, infected prey consume susceptible prey in the form of a Holling-type interaction. The conditions of all biologically feasible equilibrium points were examined. The local stability of the systems around these equilibrium points was investigated. Furthermore, the occurrence of Hopf-bifurcation concerning fear ϱ in the system was investigated. Finally, we demonstrate some numerical simulation results to illustrate our main analytical findings.

Computational Feasibility Study for Time-Frequency Analysis of Non-Stationary Vibration Signals Based on Wigner-Ville Distribution,"The time-frequency analysis has garnered attention for research due to its applications in studying non-stationary signals, revealing information often obscured by conventional time or frequency domain analysis. This study aims to reduce the computational cost associated with large dataset analysis using the smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), a valuable time-frequency tool for analyzing various signal data. We used a 9000-sample acoustic signals from a milling machine, sampled at 100 kHz. Three approaches were pursued: the first consisting in calculating the average WVD from equidistant time windows; the second consisting in reducing the sampling rate by a factor of ‘k’ by creating an array where each ‘nth’ element corresponds to the ‘k*nth’ element of the original signal; and the third consisting in a joint analysis, incorporating a preprocessing routine into the second method. The mean WVD method distorted the time-frequency diagram with middle-range frequencies, while the second approach preserved the WVD, even with significant ‘k’ factors, reducing analysis time significantly. The Incorporation of the preprocessing routine in the sampling rate reduction process markedly reduces analysis time.

Bio-Magneto Sensing and Unsupervised Deep Multiresolution Analysis for Labor Predictions in Term and Preterm Pregnancies,"The effective prediction of preterm labor continues to be a topic of interest for research within pregnancy medicine, where uterine muscle contraction signals have shown to be insightful to predict a potential preterm birth. Magnetomyography (MMG) is a physiological-measurement-based tool which measures the orthogonal offset of bioelectrical manifestations from uterine contractions and may serve to predict potential premature deliveries with an enhanced accuracy. The decoding of the physiological signal is an area of substantial research where classical signal processing approaches and metaheuristics optimization routines have been utilized in the postprocessing and decomposition of MMG signals. This work requires a degree of expert knowledge and an understanding of tuning and parameter initialization. As a stride towards creating a more automated clinical decision support platform for predictions of preterm labor, we employ the use of a deep wavelet scattering (DWS) model. This methodology allows for a deep multiresolution analysis alongside unsupervised feature learning for the postprocessing of candidate MMG signals. DWS is combined with select pattern-recognition-based prediction machines in order to assemble a clinical decision pipeline for the prediction of the states of various pregnancies, with a greater degree of machine intelligence. The patient cohort consisted of a multi-ethnic demographic population composed of preterm and term pregnancies, where births occurred both under and over 48 h after labor commenced. Contrasting results were found between the various methods from the literature and DWS using the logistic regression algorithm. It was seen that DWS produced a slightly lower accuracy in comparison, as a trade-off for its streamlined unsupervised feature extraction process. Further work will now involve the application of various other machine learning methods in an attempt to assess and identify the most appropriate machine learning method with DWS that proves to be the most accurate.

Sons al Balcó: A Subjective Approach to the WASN-Based LAeq Measured Values during the COVID-19 Lockdown,"The lockdown in Spain due to COVID-19 caused a strong decrease in the urban noise levels observed in most cities, clearly followed in the case that these cities had acoustic sensor networks deployed. This fact had an impact on people’s lives, who, at that time, were mainly locked at home due to health reasons. In this paper, we present a qualitative analysis of the subjective vision of the citizens participating in a data-collecting campaign during the COVID-19 lockdown in Girona, a Catalan city, named ‘Sons al Balcó’. The alignment of the subjective data gathered was too scarce to conduct final conclusions, but already giving a bias of the results indicates that the objective LAeq measurements, which showed a clear decrease in noise in the streets during the lockdown, were supported by the fact that new sounds found during the lockdown were not very annoying. Former existing noise sources, such as road traffic noise or leisure noise, are depicted as annoying but their decrease during the lockdown improved the soundscape of many homes. This paper’s goal is to show the possibility of gathering both objective and calibrated data with perceptive approximation for the first time in ‘Sons al Balcó’, and how this supports our conclusions, in survey with a limited number of participants conducted during the 2020 lockdown period in Catalonia.

Deep Learning-Enabled Pest Detection System Using Sound Analytics in the Internet of Agricultural Things,"Around the globe, agriculture has grown to a point where it is now a financially feasible way to produce more sophisticated cultivation methods. Throughout the long tradition of agriculture, this represents a pivotal moment. The widespread adoption of data and the latest technological advances in the contemporary period allowed this paradigm change. However, pests remain to blame for significant harm done to crops, which has a detrimental impact on finances, the natural world, and society. This highlights the necessity of using automated techniques to apprehend pests before they cause widespread harm. Agriculture-related issues are currently the predominant subject for research that utilizes ML. The overarching aim of this investigation is the development of an economically feasible method for pest detection in vast fields of crops that IoT enables through the use of pest audio sound analytics. The recommended approach incorporates numerous acoustic preparation methods from audio sound analytics. The Chebyshev filter; the Welch method; the non-overlap-add method; FFT, DFT, STFT, and LPC algorithms; acoustic sensors; and PID sensors are among them. Eight hundred pest sounds were examined for features and statistical measurements before being incorporated into Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for training, testing, and validation. The experiment’s outcomes demonstrated that the proposed MLP model triumphed over the currently available DenseNet, VGG-16, YOLOv5, and ResNet-50 approaches alongside an accuracy of 99.78%, a 99.91% sensitivity, a 99.64% specificity, a 99.59% recall, a 99.82% F1 score, and a 99.85% precision. The significance of the findings rests in their potential to proactively identify pests in large agricultural fields. As a result, the cultivation of crops will improve, leading to increased economic prosperity for agricultural producers, the country, and the entire globe.

A Pore Classification System for the Detection of Additive Manufacturing Defects Combining Machine Learning and Numerical Image Analysis,"This study aims to enhance additive manufacturing (AM) quality control. AM builds 3D objects layer by layer, potentially causing defects. High-resolution micrograph data capture internal material defects, e.g., pores, which are vital for evaluating material properties, but image acquisition and analysis are time-consuming.

Pixel-based features are extracted using, e.g., Sobel and Gaussian filters on the input micrograph image. Standard image processing algorithms detect pore defects, generating labels based on different features, e.g., area, convexity, aspect ratio, and circularity, and providing an automated feature labeling for training. This approach achieves sufficient accuracy by training a Random Forest as a hybrid-model data-driven classifier, compared with a pure data-driven model such as a CNN.

In the proposed article, we present a novel architecture together with its implementation as a proof-of-concept of a traceability and auditing IoT system based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed solution, a smart contract-based system for occupational risk prevention (ORP) has been developed to monitor oxygen concentration in confined spaces that exist in ships and shipyards. The system has been devised for the operators that weld inside the ships of the Spanish shipbuilding company Navantia, which is one of the largest shipbuilders in the world. Specifically, the IOTA network has been used, which benefits the system through its decentralized, secure, and scalable data structure. In addition, the integration of smart contracts allows for establishing predefined rules and conditions, ensuring the execution of logic in a reliable and automated manner. To demonstrate the viability of the system, it has been tested locally and in the IOTA testing environment. Despite the challenges in deploying smart contracts with IOTA, the developed system is considered useful for the traceability and auditing of the oxygen concentrations without the need for any human intervention. Furthermore, it establishes the groundwork for future advancements in IoT traceability and auditing in industrial ORP scenarios.

Statistical Analysis of Gyroscopic Data to Determine Machine Health in Additive Manufacturing,"Additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, has significantly advanced component production across multiple industry sectors. Despite its numerous benefits, including reduced lead times and the ability to produce complex geometries, a few obstacles still prevent widespread adoption. Current research efforts have predominantly focused on in situ monitoring and investigating the mechanical properties of 3D-printed materials, with limited attention given to the sources of skewness in the fabricated products. To address this gap, our study aims to explore the factors contributing to skewness in 3D-printed objects. Specifically, we examine the influence of the belt and carriage wheel conditions within the 3D printer on the shape of the fabricated products, resulting from potential distortions in the orientation of the print head carriage during the printing process. A comprehensive analysis was employed, utilizing One-Way ANOVA, Tukey’s test, the Fisher Least Significant Difference Method, and the Friedman Rank Test, to establish statistically significant evidence supporting the notion that the mechanical components, namely the belt and wheel, have a substantial impact on the orientation of the print head, consequently leading to skewness in the final 3D-printed products.

On the Use of Muscle Activation Patterns and Artificial Intelligence Methods for the Assessment of the Surgical Skills of Clinicians,"The ranking and evaluation of a surgeon’s surgical skills is an important factor in order to be able to appropriately assign patient cases according to the necessary level of surgeon competence in addition to helping us in the process of pinpointing the specific clinicians within the surgical cohort who require further developmental training. One of the more frequent means of surgical skills evaluation is through a qualitative assessment of a surgeon’s portfolio alongside other supporting pieces of information, a process which is rather subjective. The contribution presented as part of this paper involves the use of a set of Delsys Trigno EMG wearable sensors, which track and record the muscular activation patterns of a surgeon during a surgical procedure, alongside computationally driven artificial intelligence (AI) methods towards the differentiation and ranking of the surgical skills of a clinician in a quantitative fashion.

Interaction of the Fluorescent Cell-Labeling Dye Rhodamine 6G with Low-Molecular-Weight Compounds: A Comparative QCM Study of Adsorption Capacity of Rh6G for Gaseous Analytes,"Rhodamine 6G is widely used in biochemistry and cell imaging as a sensitive layer of chemical sensors. At the same time, the features of the interaction of Rh6G with low-molecular-weight analytes present in most biochemical preparations have not been studied. In this study, the interaction of Rh6G thin films with water vapor, acetic acid, ethyl alcohol, ammonia, benzene, pyridine, nitrobenzene, acetone, and acetonitrile in the gas phase was studied. The kinetic features and adsorption capacity of the sensitive layer were compared with those of other sensitive layer materials (macrocyclic dibenzotetraazaanulenes, phthalocyanines, and their metal complexes). The response values of the Rh6G-based sensor significantly exceed the responses of other sensors, regardless of the type of analyte. This means that this material is promising for multivariate sensor arrays, where the issue of cross-selectivity is a prerequisite. However, when developing selective sensors or when using Rhodamine 6G for analytical analysis in biochemistry, the ability of Rh6G to interact with a wide range of low-molecular-weight analytes must be taken into account.

Experimental Measurement of Air Temperature in an Enclosure Using Ultrasonic Oscillating Temperature Sensors (Uotses),"In this paper, we present experimental findings related to the measurement of air temperature within an enclosure. We utilized both a conventional temperature sensor and a UOTS (ultra-sensitive oscillating temperature sensor) for this purpose. The UOTS’s output frequency was measured using a microcontroller’s timer and direct memory access. In one experiment, we subjected the air inside the enclosure to rapid heating to evaluate the responsiveness of both sensors. In another experiment, the air temperature was indirectly increased through the laboratory’s heating system. The initial experiment reaffirmed the superior responsiveness of the UOTS, as observed in previous tests. The second experiment, conducted over a duration of more than 20 h, allowed us to establish a frequency-temperature curve for the UOTS. It also enabled us to determine that the UOTS exhibits sensitivity at approximately 45 Hz per degree Celsius. This assessment provided valuable insights into temperature underestimation by the conventional temperature sensor, revealing a discrepancy of 9 °C during the rapid heating experiment. This quantified the significant advantage offered by the UOTS in terms of accuracy and responsiveness.

The proposed system is designed and developed in the SimuLTE/OMNeT++ simulation for simulating an LTE network infrastructure connecting the Wireless Sensors Network (WSN) with a remote server, where data are collected. In this frame, two network topologies are studied: Scenario A, a single-hop (one-tier) network, which represents a multi-cell network where multiple sensors are associated with different base stations, sending water measurements to the remote server through them, and Scenario B, a two-tier network, which is again a multi-cell network, but this time, multiple sensors are associated to local aggregators, which first collect and aggregate the measurements and then send them to the remote server through the LTE base stations.

The Detection of E. coli and S. aureus on Sensors without Immobilization by Using Impedance Spectroscopy,"The impedance spectroscopy method (AC f = 4–8 MHz at a constant amplitude of 1 V) and Pt-IDE sensors were used to detect and monitor different concentrations (103, 106, and 109 CFU/mL) of both live and dead bacteria cells (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus). The analysis of the impedance spectra shows the differences in resistance with increasing concentrations for both types of bacteria and the presence of characteristic changes in the frequency range 10–100 kHz. The presence of live bacteria led to a decrease in the impedance value compared to dead cells, and the value of Rs + Rct decreased about two times.

A Fuzzy Logic- and Internet of Things-Based Smart Irrigation System,"Conventional irrigation methods frequently generate excessive or inadequate watering, resulting in the wastage of water and energy and diminished agricultural yields. This study presents a novel intelligent irrigation system that incorporates fuzzy logic and the Internet of Things (IoT) to automate the control of water pumps, thereby eliminating the requirement for human intervention. This novel method enables users to effectively preserve water and electricity by mitigating the issues of excessive and insufficient irrigation of crops. The system utilizes climate sensors that are combined with electrical circuits and connected to an Arduino and a fuzzy inference system (FIS) model to consider climate conditions and soil moisture levels. The sensors are responsible for collecting data that are utilized by the FIS model to control the speed of the water pump effectively. The FIS model integrates fuzzy logic to analyse the data obtained by the Arduino. This analysis enables the Arduino to adjust the pump speed by considering a wide range of sensor inputs. The implementation of this autonomous system eliminates the requirement for human intervention and enhances agricultural productivity by accurately dispensing the optimal quantity of water at the proper intervals. The cessation of water supply occurs when the soil moisture levels reach a sufficient state and resumes when the moisture levels fall below predetermined limits, regulated by various environmental circumstances. A comparative analysis examines the suggested technology, drip irrigation, and manual flooding. The comparison results demonstrate that the intelligent irrigation system accomplishes water and energy conservation.

Design of Artificial Intelligence-Based Novel Device for Fault Diagnosis of Integrated Circuits,"The rapid advancement of integrated circuit (IC) technology has revolutionized various industries, but it has also introduced challenges in detecting faulty ICs. Traditional testing methods often rely on manual inspection or complex equipment, resulting in time-consuming and costly processes. In this work, a novel approach is proposed which uses a thermal camera and an Internet of Things (IoT) physical device, namely a Raspberry PI microcontroller, for the detection of faulty and non-faulty ICs. Further, a deep learning algorithm, namely You Only Look Once (YOLO), is coded inside the Raspberry PI controller using Python programming software to detect faulty ICs efficiently and accurately. Also, the various images of faulty and non-faulty ICs are used to train the algorithm and once the algorithm is trained, the thermal camera along with the Raspberry PI microcontroller is used for the real-time detection of faulty ICs and the YOLO algorithm analyzes the thermal images to identify regions with abnormal temperature patterns, indicating potential faults. The proposed approach offers several advantages over traditional methods, including increased efficiency and improved accuracy.

Federated Learning for Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave Radar Gesture Recognition for Heterogeneous Clients,"Federated learning (FL) is a field in distributed optimization. Therein, the collection of data and training of neural networks (NN) are decentralized, meaning that these tasks are carried out across multiple clients with limited communication and computation capabilities. In FL, the client NNs are first trained with locally available data. Next, they are aggregated to update a global NN. FL suffers from non-independent and identically distributed (iid) data and asynchronous communication between the server and the clients, which degrades the NN’s overall performance. In this work, we investigate FL for a small-live-gesture-sensing NN, using a low-power 60 GHz frequency modulated continuous wave radar from Infineon Technologies. The challenges of data sparsity, i.e., only a fraction of a gesture recording corresponds to an executed gesture combined with non-iid data, pose issues during neural network training. It is shown that FL reaches an accuracy higher than 96.2% for an iid setting. However, an increasing level of non-iid data degrades the accuracy to 64.8%. To tackle the accuracy degradation, we propose to dynamically adapt the class weights during the training procedure based on each client’s varying ratio of data sparsity. Moreover, regularization terms are included in the loss function to prevent client drift and overconfidence in the client’s NN prediction. Finally, it is shown that the proposed modifications increase the NN’s performance, such that an accuracy of 97% is obtained despite a high degree of non-iid data.

A High-Level Synthesis Approach for a RISC-V RV32I-Based System on Chip and Its FPGA Implementation,"In this paper, we present a RISC-V RV32I-based system-on-chip (SoC) design approach using the Vivado high-level synthesis (HLS) tool. The proposed approach consists of three separate levels: The first one is an HLS design and simulation purely in C++. The second one is a Verilog simulation of the HLS-generated Verilog implementation of the CPU core, a RAM unit initialized with a short assembly code, and a simple output port which simply forwards the output data to the simulation console. Finally, the third level is the implementation and testing of this SoC on a low-cost FPGA board (Basys3) running at a clock speed of 100 MHz. A sample C code was compiled using the GNU RISC-V compiler tool chain and tested on the HLS-generated RISC-V RV32I core as well. The HLS design consists of a single C++ file with fewer than 300 lines, a single header file, and a testbench in C++. Our design objectives are that (1) the C++ code should be easy to read for an average engineer, and (2) the coding style should dictate minimal area, i.e., minimal resource utilization, without significantly degrading the code readability. The proposed system was implemented for two different I/O bus alternatives: (1) a traditional single clock cycle delay memory interface and (2) the industry-standard AXI bus. We present timing closure, resource utilization, and power consumption estimates. Furthermore, by using the open-source synthesis tool yosys, we generated a CMOS gate-level design and provide gate count details. All design, simulation, and constraint files are publicly available in a GitHub repo. We also present a simple dual-core SoC design, but detailed multi-core designs and other advanced futures are planned for future research.

The Design and Development of an Internet of Things-Based Condition Monitoring System for Industrial Rotating Machines,"In general, the industries utilize more rotating machines and the efficient functioning of these machines is vital for the smooth operation of industrial processes. Further, the detection and identification of motor issues in a timely manner is crucial to prevent unexpected downtime and expensive repairs. In this work, a novel approach is proposed to monitor and assess the condition of motors in real-time by analyzing the environmental parameters using sensors which are capable of measuring temperature and humidity, to gather data about the operating environment of motors in industrial settings. Also, by continuously monitoring these environmental factors, deviations from optimal conditions can be detected, allowing for proactive maintenance actions to be taken. The proposed system consists of a network of temperature and humidity sensors strategically placed in proximity to the motors being monitored. Further, these sensors collect temperature and humidity data at regular intervals and transmit them to an Internet of Things (IoT) cloud platform. Finally, the data are analyzed using a fuzzy logic decision-making algorithm and are compared against predefined threshold values to determine if the motor is operating within acceptable conditions. This work appears to be of high industry relevance since automated notifications or alerts are to be sent to maintenance personnel when abnormal conditions are detected.

"Damage Detection in Machining Tools Using Acoustic Emission, Signal Processing, and Feature Extraction","The wear of tools in machining is one of the primary issues in manufacturing industries. Direct measurements of tool wear, such as microscopic observation, lead to increased machine downtime and reduced production rates. To improve this situation, real-time tool condition monitoring systems (TCMs) are needed, which utilize indirect measurement of tool wear through sensors and signal processing. This project focuses on the use of acoustic emission (AE) sensors for experimental analysis of tool damage under various milling conditions. The proposed approach involves designing condition indicators to quantify this damage by implementing infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters, specifically Butterworth filters, and fast Fourier transform (FFT), in addition to root mean square (RMS), using different frequency bands of the acoustic signals collected during the process. The results from implementing this study show promise for optimizing the process through an alternative TCM system in manufacturing operations, avoiding the drawbacks of the direct method, and extending the equipment’s lifespan and efficiency. It’s worth noting that this document presents partial results of this implementation, which is still in progress.

Carbon Allotrope-Based Textile Biosensors: A Patent Landscape Analysis,"This report aims to provide a patent landscape analysis on carbon allotrope-based textile electrodes and biosensors to measure biosignals and detect several parameters. Espacenet, a free-of-charge patent database provided by the EPO (European Patent Office) and containing data on more than 140 million patent publications from over 100 countries, was used as the reference database. The patent search was carried out by combining keywords and classification symbols. Both classification schemes (IPC–International Patent Classification and CPC–Cooperative Patent Classification) were used. As a result of this study, a total of 227 patent documents were found between 2002 and 2023. The first patent application claiming a fabric electrode arrangement with carbon black as conductive material was filed in 2002 (and published in 2004) by Philips. 2021 was the year with the highest number of published patent applications, with 36 documents. The United States was ranked first with 126 patent documents. Carbon nanotubes and graphene are the most patented carbon allotrope materials, while body temperature, motion, and heart rate measurements are the main disclosed applications. We also analyzed the Orbit database obtaining 288 patent documents (vs. 227) with only 238 still active records (148 granted and 90 pending applications): the first application by Philips on an electrode arrangement is confirmed, and the patent distribution shows a peak in the period 2016–2020 (146 records available), while today it seems to be stable or even decreasing (“only” 52 records in the half period January 2021–June 2023). This outcome suggests that this material and related technology has reached its maximum exploitation or has not demonstrated a disruptive output.

Enhancing Insider Malware Detection Accuracy with Machine Learning Algorithms,"One of the biggest cybersecurity challenges in recent years has been the risk that insiders pose. Internet consumers are susceptible to exploitation due to the exponential growth of network usage. Malware attacks are a major concern in the digital world. The potential occurrence of this threat necessitates specialized detection techniques and equipment, including the capacity to facilitate the precise and rapid detection of an insider threat.

Full-Field Modal Analysis Using Video Measurements and a Blind Source Separation Methodology,"The adoption of wireless sensor networks has brought a significant breakthrough in structural health monitoring, providing an effective alternative to the challenges associated with traditional cable-based sensors. In recent years, a growing interest in developing contactless, vision-based vibration sensors like video cameras has led to advancements, potentially alleviating the previously mentioned drawbacks. In this study, a video of a vibrating frame is converted into a set of frames, so that local phase information can be extracted. The motion matrix is then derived from the phase information; since the number of measuring points is usually greater than the number of the excited modes of the system, the problem can become over-determined. Therefore, by applying dimensionality reduction techniques, the dimension of the motion matrix is significantly reduced. Finally, by exploiting an output-only identification technique, modal parameters are computed. The proposed approach is proven to accurately identify the structural frequencies and mode shapes.

Crop Recommendation Systems Based on Soil and Environmental Factors Using Graph Convolution Neural Network: A Systematic Literature Review,"Data-driven approaches and resource management to improve yield are becoming increasingly frequent in agriculture with the progress in technology. Based on a broad variety of environmental variables, this research compares two graph-based crop recommendation algorithms, GCN and GNN. Our methods select the optimal crop for a season based on nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus levels, as well as temperature, humidity, soil pH and rainfall. We assess the dataset’s complexity using GCN and GNN, which can handle graph-based structured data well. We utilize supervised learning to structure input information as nodes in a graph with edges reflecting plausible feature relationships to predict the optimal crop based on environmental conditions. Our experiment creates a graph via data preprocessing. Crop recommendation effectiveness is assessed using F1-score, recall, accuracy and precision for both models. To prevent overfitting and ensure generalizability, we employ k-fold cross-validation. Our crop suggestion comparison of GCN vs. GNN shows their pros and cons. Due to its concentration on graph convolution and feature aggregation, GCN captures localized connections in the feature graph better than GNN, which competes in situations needing larger feature interactions. This research advances graph-based models in agriculture and highlights their potential to enhance precision agriculture. We prioritize choosing the optimum graph-based model based on the dataset’s nature and inherent links to optimize crop management and resource allocation.

Wearable Impedance-Matched Noise Canceling Sensor for Voice Pickup,"Communicating under extreme noise conditions remains challenging in spite of higher-order noise-canceling microphones, throat microphones, and signal processing. Both natural and human-made background ambient noise can disturb the conveyance of information because of high noise levels. Noise cancellation, which is used frequently in audio technology, has limits in noise reduction and does not guarantee clear vocal pickup in these severe situations. A contact microphone that is attached directly to the medium of interest has the potential to pick up vocal signals with reduced noise. In this study, an electrostatic transducer with an elastomer layer that is impedance-matched to the human body is used to pick up speech sounds through constant contact on the chin and cheek. By attaching the wearable device directly to the skin, the medium of air is bypassed, and airborne noise is passively canceled. Because of the acoustic impedance-matched layer, the sensor is more sensitive to low frequencies under 500 Hz, so frequency equalization was implemented to flatten the frequency response throughout the vocal range. The perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) scores of the wearable device with equalization averaged around 2.6 on a scale from –0.5 to 4.5. Speech recordings were also collected in a noise field of 85 dB, and the performance was compared to a cardioid lapel mic, a cardioid dynamic mic, and an omnidirectional condenser mic. The recordings revealed a significantly reduced presence of white noise in the contact sensor. This study provides preliminary results that show potential vocal applications for a wearable impedance-matched sensor.

"Design, Fabrication and Characterization of a Wideband Metamaterial Absorber for THz Imaging","In this paper, the design and optimization of a wideband THz metamaterial absorber (MMA) are proposed. By simulation, we reached four structures with absorptions higher than 50%, 70%, 80%, and 90%, with relative absorption bandwidths (RABWs) of 1.43, 1.29, 0.93, and 0.72, respectively. Terahertz absorbers can be used in many potential applications, such as in imaging, energy harvesting, scattering reduction, and thermal sensing. Our intended application was to use the optimal absorber on a thermal detector for detectivity over a wide THz range. Since broadband absorption in the range of 0.3 to 2 terahertz is considered for use in medical imaging, the MMA with more than 50% absorption in the range of 0.35-2.1 THz was selected. The designs were also intended to have the capability of being implemented on different devices, such as bolometers. The cost of the fabrication of the proposed absorber was also low because of the implementation of a single-layer MMA design and the utilization of affordable and more accessible materials and techniques. Our proposed structure had a minimum feature size of 3 μm, making the fabrication process convenient using the standard photolithography method as well. We used thin layers of nickel as the metal for both the single-layer pattern and ground layer, which were placed on the front and back sides of the structure, respectively. The nickel thin film layers were deposited using the sputtering technique and separated by a dielectric layer. The material chosen for the dielectric layer was SU8, which has proper electromagnetic properties and also good adhesion to nickel. Characterization of the fabricated absorber was performed using a terahertz spectroscopy system, and the experimental results verified the high absorption of the sample.

Optimal Resource Allocation Scheme Based on Time Slot Switching for Point-to-Point SISO SWIPT Systems,"This paper presents an optimal resource allocation scheme based on time slot switching (TS) for point-to-point single-input single-output (SISO) simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems, aiming to maximize the average achievable rate. The proposed scheme considers the nonlinear energy harvesting (EH) characteristic, and thus, the problem is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem in the presence of a binary TS ratio. Hence, solving the problem is performed using the time-sharing strong duality theorem and Lagrange dual method. Simulations showed that the proposed scheme improves energy efficiency with respect to different transmission powers by 20%, 10%, and 3% for high-SNR, medium-SNR, and low-SNR regions, respectively. Improvement with respect to average energy efficiency versus other system performance metrics has also been noted for the proposed scheme.

Transfer Learning-Based Anomaly Detection System for Autonomous Vehicle,"The advancements in technology have brought about significant changes in the automobile industry. A system that combines the control of a physical process with computing technology and communication networks is called a cyber–physical system (CPS). The enhancement of network communication has transitioned vehicles from purely mechanical to software-controlled technologies. The controller area network (CAN) bus protocol controls the communication network of autonomous vehicles. The convergence of technologies in autonomous vehicles (AVs) and connected vehicles (CVs) within Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) leads to improved traffic flow, enhanced safety, and increased reliability.

Towards a Simple and Efficient Implementation of Solar Photovoltaic Emulator: An Explicit PV Model Based Approach,"A photovoltaic emulator (PVE) is a specialized device designed to mimic the static and dynamic properties of a solar panel. It serves as a crucial tool for testing and validating PV systems. Despite the unpredictable variations in real environmental conditions, the PVE offers a controlled environment, facilitating the smooth implementation and testing of PV subsystems. The PVE consists of two essential components: the reference PV model and the PVE power electronics controller. For simplicity, both these elements must be inherently straightforward. Numerous advanced methods have been proposed in the literature to efficiently integrate the PV model into the PVE system. However, these approaches often involve complex iterative computations of intricate equations related to solar panels, making them less practical. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel PVE that aims to simplify the implementation and integration of the PV model. The proposed system employs a simple and non-iterative approach to provide the reference to the PVE, using a straightforward explicit model of the solar panel. In comparison to existing works, the proposed PVE stands out for its high flexibility and simplicity as it does not require the complex iterative computations of implicit equations related to the solar panel model. The overall PVE system is implemented with a basic proportional-integral (PI) controller and a DC-DC buck power electronic converter. It is then validated using a 200 W solar panel through a series of experiments, including the EN 50530 Test. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the proposed PVE efficiently reproduces the static and dynamic characteristics of a solar panel.

New Photoacoustic Cell Design for Solid Samples,"We have developed a new design for a photoacoustic (PA) cell particularly suited for quartz-enhanced photoacoustic spectroscopy (QEPAS), where a quartz tuning fork (QTF) is used as a sound detector for the PA signal. The cell is designed for the investigation of solid and semi-solid samples and represents a unilateral open cylinder. The antinode of the sound pressure of the fundamental longitudinal mode of the half-open cylinder occurs directly at the sample, where a measurement is difficult. Therefore, the first harmonic is used. A small hole in the resonator wall at the location of the pressure antinode allows signal detection outside the cylinder without (or only minimally) changing the resonance conditions. This design is particularly simple and easy to manufacture. A finite element (FE) simulation is applied to determine the optimal cell length for the given frequency and the location of the pressure maximum. One difficulty is that the open end dramatically changes the acoustic sound field. We answer the following research questions: where is the sound pressure maximum located and do simple analytical equations agree with the results of the FE simulation?

The Implementation and Advantages of a Discrete Fourier Transform-Based Digital Eddy Current Testing Instrument,"An eddy current testing instrument is the core equipment for non-destructive testing (NDT) in nuclear power plants, and its performance is of great significance to ensure the safety of nuclear power units throughout their life cycle. At present, mainstream eddy current instruments use analog circuits for signal processing, whose structure is complex, and there are shortcomings such as large noise and weak anti-interference ability. To improve the performance of eddy current instruments, this paper creatively proposes a digital signal processing method. In this method, ARM+FPGA is used as the core of signal processing, and a DFT digital signal processing algorithm is used instead of traditional hardware detection circuits to complete the processing of eddy current signals. The parallel DFT operation is realized in the algorithm, and up to 10 superimposed signals of different frequencies can be operated simultaneously, which further improves the detection efficiency of the instrument. The measured results show that the digital instrument designed in this paper greatly simplifies the hardware circuit, reduces the overall electronic noise level, and improves the signal-to-noise ratio and detection efficiency. The instrument supports BOBBIN, MRPC and ARRAY detection technologies, which fully meets the application needs of NDT in nuclear power plants.

In this paper, it is suggested that an IoT-based fuzzy control system be used for smart soil monitoring systems. This study is based on the semi-arid regions of India. A fuzzy classifier is used to categorize the real-time data into three parameters, such as sodium, potassium, and calcium, based on the proposed model, which gets trained from a dataset and then chooses the optimal solution. The real-time data are collected from NPK sensors, which are suitable for sensing the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the territory, which helps in determining the fertility of the soil by facilitating the systematic assessment of the soil condition. With the aid of this system, a farmer would be able to monitor soil health in a real-time environment and also track the growth of their plants. Farmers will be able to enhance productivity while decreasing resource waste with the aid of an IoT-enabled fuzzy system. Experimental data have been collected from Mahoba district, Uttar Pradesh provinces in India, and the results show that the suggested system is a more reliable and precise concept used for precision farming that will certainly enhance the overall production of crops with better quality. These results obtained with the help of the proposed model system have been compared with the existing one with data accuracy that has been improved and well accepted.

ProgMachina: Feature Extraction and Processing Package for Prognostic Studies,"Prognostic studies of industrial systems essentially focus on health deterioration analysis that has recently been oriented toward data analytics and learning systems. In general, real degradation phenomena suffer from complex drifted data in which degradation patterns are hidden and change over time. Accordingly, such a process requires a well-structured processing and extraction mechanism to reveal such patterns, which facilitates the transition to other model reconstruction and investigation tasks. In this context, to provide additional simplicity of data processing in the field, a complete software package is designed and grouped into a single function that is fully automated and does not require human intervention. The package named ProgMachina (i.e., prognostic machine) provides a featured list of processed features from a life cycle that passed through denoising, filtering, outlier removal, and scaling process to ensure data significance in terms of degradation. The package allows for the use of a time window with a specific overlap to ensure that the scanning process of all possible degradation patterns is properly done. Additionally, an exponential function is used to identify a corresponding health index of degraded signals. In addition, a set of well-known metrics is used to assess the degradation of extracted features. Data visualization and many previous experiments on machines show the effectiveness of such a methodology in terms of obtained prediction accuracy and degradation assessment. The package is designed with Matlab software and made available online to be exploited in similar fields.

Getting a Better Sense of Data Drift in Dynamic Systems: Sequence-Based Deep Learning for Monitoring Slowly Evolving Degradation Processes,"Deep Learning (DL) for monitoring slowly evolving degradation processes typically involves overcoming data drift, complexity, and unavailability issues resulting from dynamic and harsh conditions and the rarity of labeled failure patterns, respectively. While degradation patterns are mostly hidden in such complex data, observation-based DL is prone to producing uncertain predictions and/or overfit models during the training process. This problem is usually caused by the insignificance of certain data representations. Therefore, and particularly due to the sequential nature of data in such a degradation process, it is necessary to consider neighboring observations to judge the accuracy of a representation or improve it. In this context, instead of providing traditional observation-based learning philosophy, this paper presents data-driven sequential mapping while additionally showing that health indices can also be represented as a vector of sequential data and not as a single regressor output changing a model’s architecture. Using a dataset generated from a mathematical model mimicking bearing degradation life cycles and responding to the aforementioned three main challenges, a comparative study built on investigating observation-based and sequence-based learning paths was conducted. According to a well-defined visual and numerical evaluation criterion, a sequence-based methodology reflects a better understanding of data representations through parameter tuning, achieving better approximation and generalization. Such results support the necessity of such a learning mechanism, especially for sequential data, dealing with some sort of correlation and degrading controversy. The files required to reproduce the findings of this work have been made publicly available.

Optimization of the Geometry of a Microelectromechanical System Testing Device for SiO2—Polysilicon Interface Characterization,"Microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs) are small-scale devices that combine mechanical and electrical components made through microfabrication techniques. These devices have revolutionized numerous technological applications, owing to their miniaturization and versatile functionalities. However, the reliability of MEMS devices remains a critical concern, especially when operating in harsh conditions like high temperatures and humidities. The unknown behavior of their structural parts under cyclic loading conditions, possibly affected by microfabrication defects, poses challenges to ensuring their long-term performance. This research focuses on addressing the reliability problem by investigating fatigue-induced delamination in polysilicon-based MEMS structures, specifically at the interface between SiO2 and polysilicon. Dedicated test structures with piezoelectric actuation and sensing for closed-loop operation were designed, aiming to maximize stress in regions susceptible to delamination. By carefully designing these structures, a localized stress concentration is induced to facilitate the said delamination and help understand the underlying failure mechanism. The optimization was performed by taking advantage of finite element analyses, allowing a comprehensive analysis of the mechanical responses of the movable parts of the polysilicon MEMS under cyclic loading.

Machine Learning for Accurate Office Room Occupancy Detection Using Multi-Sensor Data,"In this paper, we present a comparative study of several machine learning (ML) approaches for accurate office room occupancy detection through the analysis of multi-sensor data. Our study utilizes the occupancy detection dataset, which incorporates data from temperature, humidity, light, and CO2 sensors, with ground-truth labels obtained from time-stamped images captured at minute intervals. Traditional ML techniques, including Decision Trees (DT), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) are compared alongside advanced ensemble methods like RandomForest (RF), Bagging, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, ExtraTrees as well as our custom voting and multiple stacking classifiers.

Improving Hand Pose Recognition Using Localization and Zoom Normalizations over MediaPipe Landmarks,"Hand pose recognition presents significant challenges that need to be addressed, such as varying lighting conditions or complex backgrounds, which can hinder accurate and robust hand pose estimation. This can be mitigated by employing MediaPipe to facilitate the efficient extraction of representative landmarks from static images combined with the use of Convolutional Neural Networks. Extracting these landmarks from the hands mitigates the impact of lighting variability or the presence of complex backgrounds. However, the variability of the location and size of the hand is still not addressed by this process. Therefore, the use of processing modules to normalize these points regarding the location of the wrist and the zoom of the hands can significantly mitigate the effects of these variabilities. In all the experiments performed in this work based on American Sign Language alphabet datasets of 870, 27,000, and 87,000 images, the application of the proposed normalizations has resulted in significant improvements in the model performance in a resource-limited scenario. Particularly, under conditions of high variability, applying both normalizations resulted in a performance increment of 45.08%, increasing the accuracy from 43.94 ± 0.64% to 89.02 ± 0.40%.

Electrical and Optical Properties of Controlled Reduced Graphene Oxide Prepared by a Green and Facile Route,"Three distinct homogeneous multilayer self-standing thin films, composed of stacked reduced graphene oxide (rGO) planes, were produced by the improved Hummer’s method. In order to investigate their structural, electrical, and optical properties, the samples were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), four-point probe measurements, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The Raman spectra of the samples indicate the presence of minor surface defects and a relatively low oxygen content of rGOs. The FESEM images obtained from the samples reveal a smooth sheet-like surface with few wrinkles. Additionally, the cross-sectional images provide confirmation of the presence of multi-stacked layer structures. Based on the resistance decreasing by about 0.35 to 0.65 percent per kelvin within the region of ambient temperature, the electrical resistance vs. temperature curves imply semiconducting behavior in the rGOs. The FTIR analysis of the samples conducted within the wavelength range of 2.5 to 25 µm demonstrates a significant absorption value exceeding 90%. This observation shows that the developed materials possess favorable characteristics, making them an excellent absorber candidate for sensing detectors in the infrared range. We systematically analyzed and confirmed that the structural as well as optical and electrical properties of our obtained rGOs may be fine-tuned by adjusting the initial reactants concentration and annealing temperature.

Comparison of the Effectiveness and Performance of Student Workgroups in Online Wiki Activities with and without AI,"Collaborative learning has been widely acknowledged as a successful teaching method within the education field, with research indicating its positive impact on student outcomes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when all courses transitioned online due to lockdown measures, many universities employed learning management systems to facilitate continued group work among students. However, forming effective student groups remained challenging, particularly given the large number of enrolled students. To address this issue, this study proposes the application of an artificial intelligence (machine learning) solution to automatically group students based on their behaviours and interactions within an e-learning environment. This paper explores the potential of machine learning (ML) algorithms in assisting educators to create heterogeneous groups, considering various student attributes, such as behaviour and performance, to optimise collaborative learning outcomes. Students’ performance within a module was compared using a wiki activity that employed group work over the course of two academic years. In the first experiment, groups were formed randomly, while in the second experiment, students with similar behaviours were firstly identified using a clustering algorithm and then organised by an additional algorithm into heterogeneous groups. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the machine learning solution compared to the random approach in assisting educators with group formation for a collaborative activity such as the wiki, confirmed by a comparative analysis showing an improvement in student performance and satisfaction. This research contributes to the advancement of online education through the creation of more effective group dynamics using machine learning algorithms, thereby improving overall student learning.

A High-Precision Robotic System Design for Microsurgical Applications,"The introduction of robotic systems in medical surgery has achieved the goal of decreasing procedures’ invasiveness, positively impacting the patient’s prognosis by reducing the incision size, surgical infections, and hospitalization time. Nowadays, robotic surgery is used as an integral part of urology, gynecology, abdominal, and cardiac interventions. Despite its adoption in several surgical specialties, robotic technology remains limited in the area of microsurgery. In this paper, we present the development of a robotic system providing sub-millimeter motion resolution for the potential manipulation of fine structures. The design is based on linear delta robotic geometry. The motion, resolution, and repeatability of the developed system were simulated, followed by proof-of-concept experimental testing. The developed system achieved a motion resolution of 3.37 ± 0.17 µm in both the X- and Y-axes and 1.32 ± 0.2 µm in the Z-axis. We evaluated the system navigation, setting a zigzag trajectory with dimensions below those found in blood vessels (300 to 800 µm), and found that the system is capable of achieving a maximum resolution of 3.06 ± 0.03 µm. These results demonstrate the potential application of the here-presented robotic system for its use in microsurgical applications such as neurosurgery, plastic, and breast cancer surgeries.

Structural Identification Using Digital Image Correlation Technology,"Structural health monitoring has gained increasing research interest, particularly due to the societal concerns tied to the aging of current civil structures and infrastructures. By managing datasets collected through a network of sensors deployed over monitored structures, (big) data analytics can be executed. Traditional inertial sensors, such as accelerometers or strain gauges, necessitate intricate cable arrangements and lead to high maintenance costs. Lately, there has been a growing interest in non-contact, vision-based approaches to tackle these aforementioned issues. Among these methods, digital image correlation (DIC) can furnish a representation of tracked displacements at various points of a structure, particularly if physically attached targets are employed. In this study, a video capturing the vibrations of a structure was analyzed, with a focus on specific points, such as structural nodes where damage could be initiated or whose responses could be impacted by the mentioned damage. Displacement time histories were acquired, and a blind source identification technique was adopted to delve into the data and assess structural health. The proposed methodology demonstrates its capacity to accurately extract the vibration frequencies and mode shapes of the structure, even when they change in time due to damage.

Study of the Temperature Influence on an Electret Microphone in the Monitoring of Fused Deposition Modeling,"The evaluation of the response of sensors fixed to the print bed in the fused filament fabrication (FFF) process has been the subject of recent studies due to the increasing use of the FFF process. Many of these studies focus on topics related to monitoring the FFF process through the signals collected by sensors. Recently, some works employing piezoelectric diaphragm and electret microphones can be found in the monitoring of the FFF process, but the influence of the transducer response due to the variation of temperature has not been addressed. Thus, this work presents a study of the response of a low-cost electret microphone attached to the print bed under different temperature values. A 3D printer with polylactic acid (PLA) filament was used in the tests, which consisted of applying the pencil lead break method (PLB on the heated print bed at temperature values ranging from 25 °C to 65 °C. The acoustic waves generated by the tests were captured by the electret microphone attached near the breakage point, and the signals were sampled using an oscilloscope at a frequency of 2 MHz. The signals were processed in the time and frequency domains, followed by comparative analyses between the signals obtained for different temperature values. The results showed that it was not possible to determine a single temperature value at which the response of the electret microphone starts to undergo significant changes, but rather there is inconsistent change in the transducer’s response across all frequency bands, indicating that the influence of temperature takes place in a complex way as frequency varies. This complexity is further evidenced by the non-linear behavior of RMSD values for the evaluated temperatures. Thus, the results can be helpful to those who use this type of transducer attached to the printing bed for monitoring purposes.

Vision-Based Structural Identification Using an Enhanced Phase-Based Method,"Operational modal analysis is based on data collected using a network of sensors installed on a monitored structure to measure its response to the external stimuli. As the instrumentation can be costly, sensors are placed at a limited number of locations where damage-sensitive features can hopefully be sensed. Hence, the actual ability to detect a shift from the undamaged structural state in real time might be detrimentally affected. Non-contact measurement methods relying on, e.g., digital video cameras, which have gained interest in recent years, can instead provide high-resolution and diffused measurements/information. In this study, moving from videos of a vibrating structure, a shift in its dynamic response was assessed. By means of a phase-based optical flow methodology, a linear correlation between the phase and the structural motion was customarily assumed using, e.g., the Gabor filter. Since such a correlation does not result in being always linear, linearization is necessary for all the frames. By using the blind source separation method, mode shapes and vibration frequencies were finally obtained. The performance of the proposed method is investigated to verify the accuracy in extracting the dynamic features of the considered structure using the proposed method.

Detection of Chest X-ray Abnormalities Using CNN Based on Hyperparameter Optimization,"The chest X-ray (CXR) is a commonly used diagnostic imaging test that requires significant expertise and careful observation due to the complex nature of the pathology and fine texture of lung lesions. Despite the long-term clinical training and professional guidance provided to radiologists, there is still the possibility of errors in diagnosis. Therefore, we have developed a novel approach using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect the abnormalities of CXR images. The model was optimized using algorithms such as Adam and RMSprop. Also, several hyperparameters were optimized, including the pooling layer, convolutional layer, dropout layer, target size, and epochs. Hyperparameter optimization aims to improve the model’s accuracy by testing various combinations of hyperparameter values and optimization algorithms. To evaluate the model’s performance, we used scenario modeling to create 32 models and tested them using a confusion matrix. The results indicated that the best accuracy achieved by the model was 97.94%. This accuracy was based on training and test data using 4538 CXR images. The findings suggest that hyperparameter optimization can improve the CNN model’s accuracy in accurately identifying CXR abnormalities. Therefore, this study has important implications for improving the accuracy and reliability of CXR image interpretation, which could ultimately benefit patients by improving the detection and treatment of lung diseases. Acknowledging dataset constraints, we address future steps for model improvement.

Fast Flapping Aerodynamics Prediction Using a Recurrent Neural Network,"One of the major tasks of aerodynamics is the study of the flow around airfoils. While most conventional methods deal well with steady flows, unsteady airfoils, like the ones on helicopter blades, are subject to such complex dynamic flows that their study can impose substantial difficulties. However, recent applications of machine learning, in the form of neural networks, have shown very promising results when dealing with complex dynamic aerodynamic phenomena. For this reason, this paper proposes the implementation of a recurrent neural network for the time-wise prediction of the lift, momentum, and drag coefficients for an airfoil subject to plunging motion, using the Re, k, h, kh and the time history of the effective angle of attack as inputs. Results from early training already suggest the network’s capability to approximate the desired outputs, even if with some limitations. However, the network configuration is flexible enough to be fed with either experimental or numerical data in the future.

Simulation of ZnO Nanofils as Applications for Acetone Gas Sensors,"Our objective is to present a valuable contribution towards designing more efficient sensors using undoped ZnO nanofils. The utilization of nanostructures based on ZnO has led to significant enhancements in sensor performance, due to the excellent chemical and thermal stability exhibited at its high melting temperature, our work, we focused on modeling the behavior of ZnO semiconductors by employing the Schottky defect model as a source of free carriers. Specifically, we examined the theoretical model of oxygen molecule adsorption and desorption. We explored two types of molecules responsible for adsorbing reducing gases, taking acetone gas as an example. Through the use of the COMSOL software, we found that the interaction between the solid and gas occurs at a considerably lower temperature of 295 °C, compared to ZnO thin films, which typically require temperatures as high as 500 °C. This outcome can be attributed to the behavior of ZnO nanostructures, where the influence of side surfaces (1010) is predominant, along with their lower activation energy compared to (0002) surfaces. These ZnO nanofils exhibit numerous active and thermodynamically favorable surfaces, which facilitate the adsorption of reducing gases. Employing simulation methods, such as COMSOL, offers an effective approach for achieving an optimal device design, thereby ensuring superior device performance. This research demonstrates the potential of using undoped ZnO nanofils for the development of highly efficient sensors with enhanced operational characteristics.

It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of installing these technologies into homes across the UK and the impact it has on the “net-zero housing” scheme. A series of results were produced using the SAP rating, deploying an existing dwelling located in Bradford, UK, fitted with a gas boiler and comparing the results to those obtained for an air source heat pump (ASHP) and a mechanical ventilation with heat recovery system (MVHR). The three systems were analysed in terms of cost-effectiveness, carbon footprint and energy savings. The study found that the installation of a gas boiler costs less than that of the other systems, whilst ASHPs involve high upfront costs. However, the latter showed higher energy savings, with an efficiency of 4.0 compared to 0.75 and 0.95 for the gas boiler and MVHR, respectively. The SAP rating showed that the ASHP had a carbon footprint of 2396.3 kg/year for the studied flat of 65.72 m2, whilst carbon footprints of 3406.92 CO2 kg/year and 7143.45 kg/year were determined for the gas boiler and the MVHR system, respectively. The study concluded that ASHPs work better than the other systems for most of the existing UK housing, unless a whole building fabric improvement is considered, in which case, some other renewable options could be a choice.

Temperature-Dependent Dielectric Studies of Copper-and-Magnesium-Doped Zinc Aluminate: Implications for Electrical Behaviour,"Copper (Cu2+)-and-magnesium (Mg2+)-doped Zinc aluminate ZnAl2O4 is a promising material with diverse applications in electronic and energy storage devices. In this study, the synthesis of Zn0.9MxAl2O4 (M = Cu2+ and Mg2+; x = 0.00 and 0.10) was conducted via the sol–gel combined combustion technique. The structural, spectral, optical and dielectric parameters of the synthesized spinel aluminates were analysed to explore the substitution effect of Cu2+ and Mg2+ content. The formation and crystallinity analyses of the single-phase cubic spinel structure in the synthesized spinel aluminates were confirmed using XRD patterns. The lattice parameter and grain size were ascertained from the XRD data. The crystallite size of Cu2+ and Mg2+ substituted into ZnAl2O4 using Scherrer’s formula was found to be around 22 nm. The spinel structure formations in the prepared spinel aluminates were ascertained through an FT-IR study. The UV-Vis spectra exhibited a broad absorption band in the UV-Vis region, indicating the presence of electronic transitions. The band gap energy of the prepared aluminates was estimated from the absorption edge, with values varying between 2.90 eV and 3.03 eV, revealing its suitability for optoelectronic applications. Measurement of the dielectric parameters was performed in the frequency range of 100 Hz to 20 MHz at temperatures ranging from 30 °C to 250 °C. The dielectric constant (ε′) and dielectric loss (ε”) were determined as a function of frequency at different temperatures. The results showed that the dielectric constant decreased with increasing frequency for all the observed temperatures, while the dielectric loss exhibited a peak at a specific temperature. The conductivity results indicate that the conduction mechanism occurred due to polaron hopping. The Arrhenius relation was adopted to calculate the activation energies Ea for all the samples, and the values were between 0.70 eV and 0.38 eV. The obtained results were discussed and interpreted. These findings contribute to our understanding of the electrical behaviour of doped zinc aluminate materials and their useful applications in different electronic and energy systems.

A Comparative Study on Structural Displacement Prediction by Kernelized Regressors under Limited Training Data,"An accurate prediction of the structural response in the presence of limited training data still represents a big challenge if machine learning-based approaches are adopted. This paper investigates and compares two state-of-the-art kernelized supervised regressors to predict the structural response of a long-span bridge retrieved from spaceborne remote sensing technology. The kernelized supervised procedure is either based on a support vector regression or on a Gaussian process regression. A small set of displacement time histories and corresponding air temperature data are fed into the regressors to predict the actual structural response. Results demonstrate that the proposed regression techniques are reliable, even when only 30% of the training data are used at the learning stage.

Regression Tree Ensemble to Forecast Thermally Induced Responses of Long-Span Bridges,"The ambient temperature is a critical factor affecting the deformation of long-span bridges, due to its seasonal fluctuations. Although there exist various sensor technologies and measurement techniques to extract the actual structural response in terms of the displacement field, this is a demanding task in long-term monitoring. To address this challenge, data prediction looks to be the best solution. In this paper, the thermally induced response of a long-span bridge is forecasted with a regression tree ensemble method in conjunction with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, adopted to tune the proposed regressor. Results testify that the offered method is reliable when there is a linear correlation between the temperature and the induced structural deformation, hence in terms of the thermally induced displacement field.

Modeling and Optimization of the Ammonium Solution Extraction Process,"Calcined soda production is one of the important parts of the industry. One of the main problems in the production of soda is the waste of raw materials. Disposing of some raw materials as waste not only causes economic damage but also has a negative impact on the environment. Absorption is the main process in the production of calcined soda. By finding the optimal consumption of the chemical components involved in absorption process, it will be possible to reduce the amount of raw materials released into the waste. In this work, initially, the kinetic model of the absorption process was found using the stoichiometric matrix method. Based on the stoichiometric matrix, the main components (NH3, CO2, NH4HCO3, NaCl) participating in the chemical reaction were identified. Using the found kinetic model, a computer model of the absorption process was simulated in the MATLAB program. Based on the simulated computer model, a diagram of changes in the concentration of components in the absorption process over time was obtained. The use of the considered mathematical model as part of the absorption process control system allows: (1) Reduce the loss of the amount of gases used in the absorption process; (2) Provide the required concentration of liquid saturated with ammonia; (3) Determine the required temperature regime along the entire length of the absorber.

Nanoparticle-Induced Ionic Effects in Liquid Crystal Devices,"The applications of liquid crystals continue to expand. They include conventional and advanced liquid crystal displays, electrically controlled lenses, tunable optical elements such as filters, light shutters, waveplates, and spatial light modulators, smart windows and sensors, and reconfigurable antennas and microwave devices, to name a few. As a rule, liquid crystal devices are controlled by applying an external electric field. This field reorients liquid crystals in a desirable way, thus leading to the tunability of their physical properties. The electric-field-induced reorientation of liquid crystals can be affected by ions typically present in molecular liquid crystals. In the case of liquid crystal displays, ions in liquid crystals can lead to image sticking, a reduced voltage holding ratio, and altered electro-optical performance. Therefore, the development of efficient ways to better control ions in liquid crystal devices is of utmost importance to existing and future liquid crystal technologies. In this paper, we discuss how nanomaterials can affect the electrical properties of molecular liquid crystals. In general, nanomaterials in molecular liquid crystals can behave as ion-capturing objects or act as a source of ions. Ion-capturing nanomaterials in molecular liquid crystals can enhance their electrical resistivity. On the other hand, ion-releasing nanoparticles can lead to the opposite effect. By considering the competition between two nanoparticle-induced ionic processes, namely the ion capturing and ion releasing effects, the electrical resistivity of liquid crystals can be controlled in a desirable way.

A Comparative Design Analysis of Internal and External Frame Structures for MEMS Vibrating Ring Gyroscopes,"This research presents a comparative analysis of the two important design methodologies involved in developing microelectromechanical system (MEMS) vibrating ring gyroscopes, namely, internal and external ring gyroscopes. Internal ring gyroscopes are constructed with the outside placement of support pillars connected with the semicircular beams that are attached to the vibrating ring structure. The design importance of this particular setting effectively isolates the vibrating ring structure from any external mechanical vibrations, significantly improving the gyroscope’s performance. The internal ring structure provides exceptional precession and reliability, making this design an ideal candidate for harsh conditions, as they can sustain substantial amounts of unwanted and external vibrations without degrading the performance of the gyroscope. On the other hand, external ring gyroscopes include the placement of the support pillars within the vibrating ring structure. This particular design setting is quite convenient in terms of fabrication and provides higher gyroscopic sensitivity. However, this design may lead to coupling of the vibrational modes and potentially compromise the performance of the gyroscope. This research discusses and compares the findings of a modal analysis of the two distinguished design approaches for the MEMS vibrating ring gyroscopes.

"Exploring Different Drug Targets Responsible for the Inhibitory Activity of N, N′-Substituted Diamine Derivatives in Leishmania","The genome sequence of Leishmania has given rise to diverse novel drug targets, and their identification remains the first step in drug discovery. This study aims to identify the possible anti-leishmanicidal activity target(s) of N1, N4-[dibenzylbutane-4′,4″-(dioxymethylenebenzene)]-1,4-diamine from a plethora of pathways in kinetoplastids. The compound was docked using AutoDockTools-1.5.6 against eight co-crystallized proteins selected from the protein data bank, each representing important biosynthetic pathways. The evaluation of the best conformational protein–ligand poses showed that the N, N′-substituted diamine binds more efficiently to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) (E = −8.97 Kcal/mol and Ki = 0.267 µM; Ki co-crystallized ligand = 19.39 µM), which is responsible for the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and pteridine reductase I (PTR1) (E = −8.75 Kcal/mol and Ki = 0.387 µM; Ki co-crystallized ligand = 60.56 µM), which reduces both pterins and folates to tetrahydrobiopterin and tetrahydrofolate, respectively. Moderate binding activity by the ligand was observed for the protein kinases (CDKs) (E = −8.37 Kcal/mol and Ki = 0.729 µM; Ki co-crystallized ligand = 26.80 µM) and trypanothione reductase (TR) (E = −8.57 Kcal/mol and Ki = 0.525 µM; Ki co-crystallized ligand = 174.68 µM) of the trypanothione biosynthetic pathway. With E > −7.35 Kcal/mol and Ki > 4.10 µM, the ligand appears to have no significant inhibition of the squalene synthase (SQS), lactoyl glutathione lyase (LGL) or the pteridine synthase (TS) of the sterol, glyoxalase and trypanothione biosynthetic pathways. The efficient inhibition of G3PDH and PTR1 targets in Leishmania by N, N′-substituted diamine molecule provides more insights into understanding the mechanism of leishmanicidal activity.

Solving the Optimal Power Flow Problem in Power Systems Using the Mountain Gazelle Algorithm,"Optimal power flow (OPF) is one of the fundamental mathematical tools currently used to operate power systems within the technical limits of the transmission power system. To determine OPF, a highly non-linear complex problem, it is essential to research power system planning and control. This study presents a practical and trustworthy optimization approach for the OPF problem in electrical transmission power systems. Many intelligence optimization algorithms and methods have recently been developed to solve OPF, particularly the non-linear complex optimization problems. In this paper, a novel meta-heuristic algorithm called the mountain gazelle optimizer (MGO) is suggested for solving the OPF problem. The suggested algorithm applies the improved three single objective functions to the MGO algorithm for the best OPF issue control variable settings. Three objective functions that reflect the minimization of generating fuel cost, the minimizing of active power loss, and the minimizing of voltage deviations have been used to investigate and test the proposed algorithm on the standard IEEE 30-bus test system. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed MGO algorithm; the fuel costs are reduced by 11.407%, power losses are considerably decreased by 51.016%, and the voltage profile is significantly reduced by 91.501%. Furthermore, the outcomes produced by the proposed algorithm have also been contrasted with outcomes produced by applying other comparable optimization algorithms published in recent years. The optimal results are encouraging and demonstrate the resilience and efficacy of the suggested strategy.

Results show that ZnO negatively impacts compressive strength as its content increases from 0–2%, while TiO2 enhances it by up to 17% with 2% TiO2. By optimizing TiO2 and varying ZnO within the 0–2% range, compressive strengths between 81–100 MPa can be achieved.

Novel Approach for Asthma Detection Using Carbon Monoxide Sensor,"Around 339 million people suffer from asthma worldwide. An acute asthma attack causes difficulties in daily life activities and can sometimes be fatal. The unnecessary challenges faced by asthmatics signifies the need for a device that helps people monitor and control asthma to prevent possible attacks. A number of studies have reported an elevation of carbon monoxide in exhaled breath (eCO) of asthma patients and suggest that this can be used as an effective biomarker of lung inflammation.

This article was developed in a way that the robotic vehicle was controlled using voice commands. An android application combined with an android microcontroller was used to achieve this task. The connection between the android app and the autonomous vehicle was facilitated using Bluetooth technology. The vehicle was controlled with either the aid of the buttons on the app, or by spoken commands from the user. The movement of the vehicle was achieved by using four DC motors connected with the microcontroller at the receiver side. The commands from the app were converted into digital signals using the Bluetooth RF transmitter within a specific range (of around 100 m) of the autonomous vehicle. At the receiver end, the data gets decoded by the receiver and is fed to the microcontroller which moves the DC motors of the vehicle for navigation. The voice-controlled autonomous robotic vehicle performed navigational tasks by listening to the commands of the user. This was achieved by converting voice commands into text strings which are readable by the Arduino microcontroller on the android app in order to control the navigation of the robot. The vehicle was tested under different conditions and was observed to perform better using this technique and also the results were satisfactory when compared with other previous research that has been conducted in this area.

Tool Wear Estimation in the Milling Process Using Backpropagation-Based Machine Learning Algorithm,"Tool condition monitoring (TCM) systems are essential in milling operations to guarantee the product’s quality, and when they are paired with indirect measuring techniques, such as vibration or acoustic emission sensors, the monitoring can happen without sacrificing productivity. Some more advanced techniques in tool wear estimation are based on supervised machine learning algorithms, like several other applications in Industry 4.0’s context; however, a satisfactory performance can be obtained with simple techniques and low computational power. This work focuses on an application of tool wear estimation using a simple backpropagation neural network in a milling dataset. Statistical techniques, i.e., the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, were used as features that were extracted from indirect measurements from vibration and acoustic emission sensors’ data in a real milling testbench dataset containing multiple experiments with sensor data and a direct measure of the flank wear (VB) in most instances. The data were preprocessed, specifically to acquire clean and normalized values for the neural network training, assuming that the VB measure would be the target variable used to predict tool wear; all incomplete samples without a VB measure, as well as outliers, were removed beforehand. The train and test subsets were chosen randomly after making sure that the maximum values of every variable were represented in the training subset. A multiple topology approach was implemented to test the configurations of multiple backpropagation neural networks to determine the most suitable one based on two performance criteria, i.e., the mean absolute percent error (MAPE) and variance. Although only a simple backpropagation algorithm was used, the results were adequate to demonstrate a balance between accuracy and computational resource usage.

Enhanced Safety Logic Solver Utilizing 2oo3 Architecture with Memristor Integration,"A safety instrument function (SIF) averts hazardous incidents that may arise due to diverse anomalies within a system. The SIF prevents potential dangers by comprising three integral components—the sensing element, the logic solver, and the final element. The 2oo3 architecture is the optimal configuration for each SIF component, employing both AND and OR logic designs for its voting mechanism. Type A devices, recognized for their passive nature, exemplify robustness and reliability.

A Prototype to Prevent Fruits from Spoilage: An Approach Using Sensors with Machine Learning,"One of the significant issues facing the world right now is food deterioration. If the freshness or deterioration of a fruit can be determined before it is lost, the fruit waste problem may be mitigated. The goal of this work is to develop a simple model for tracking fruit quality using sensors with a machine learning (ML) approach. This model uses from the gases emitted by fruits to determine the ones that will ripen and require use earlier. Two gas sensors (MQ3 and MQ7) and an Arduino Uno serve as the main processing components of the suggested system. Principal component study (PCA) is a widely employed discriminating approach that has been utilised to differentiate between fresh and rotten apples based on sensed data. The study yielded a cumulative variance of 99.1% over a span of one week. The data were also evaluated using a linear Support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which achieved an accuracy of 99.96%. The distinctive feature of the system is that it evaluates the levels of spoilage based on real-time data and deploys a low-cost, straightforward model that can be used anywhere to preserve any type of fruit.

Extended Object Tracking Performance Comparison for Autonomous Driving Applications,"Extended object tracking is crucial for autonomous driving, as it enables vehicles to perceive and respond to their environment accurately by considering an object’s shape, size, and motion over time. Two commonly used methods for extended object tracking, Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) and Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD), were compared in autonomous vehicles using radar data. Both JPDA and GM-PHD perform well in tracking multiple extended objects, but GM-PHD demonstrates a performance advantage, especially in terms of the Generalized Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment (GOSPA) metric, which measures the accuracy of tracked object positions in comparison to their actual positions.

AI-Driven Blade Alignment for Aerial Vehicles’ Rotary Systems Using the A* Algorithm and Statistical Heuristics,"In aviation, precise alignment of helicopter blades is paramount for ensuring optimal performance and safety during flight operations. Manual methods for blade alignment often demand extensive calculations and experienced technicians, resulting in time-consuming processes. This research proposes an innovative AI-based algorithm to optimize blade alignment in helicopter rotary systems, integrating the A* algorithm and a statistical heuristic function. The algorithm seeks to minimize the standard deviation of blade distances from the ground, captured using high-speed distance sensors. Firstly, the initial blade positions, along with the swash plate turns’ limitations, are given to the algorithm. Later, by exploring all potential adjustments and selecting the most promising sequence to minimize the standard deviation of blade distances (considering the allowable pitch limits), the algorithm achieves precise blade alignment, enhancing helicopter performance and safety. Subsequently, the algorithm outputs the recommended sequence of adjustments to be made in the swash plate. We conducted comprehensive case studies using Mi 17 helicopters as a testbed to validate the algorithm’s efficacy. The algorithm was assessed under varying scenarios: near-perfect alignment, single-blade misalignment in upward and downward directions, and multiple blades in asymmetric positions. The results demonstrate the algorithm’s capability to swiftly recommend the precise sequence of adjustments for each control rod nut, effectively minimizing blade misalignment and reducing the standard deviation. The implications of this research are far-reaching, with them promising enhanced helicopter performance and safety across diverse application domains. By automating and streamlining the blade alignment process, the algorithm minimizes reliance on human expertise and manual calculations, ensuring consistent and accurate blade alignment in real-world scenarios.

YOLO-NPK: A Lightweight Deep Network for Lettuce Nutrient Deficiency Classification Based on Improved YOLOv8 Nano,"When it comes to growing lettuce, specific nutrients play vital roles in its growth and development. These essential nutrients include full nutrients (FN), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Insufficient or excess levels of these nutrients can have negative effects on lettuce plants, resulting in various deficiencies that can be observed in the leaves. To better understand and identify these deficiencies, a deep learning approach is employed to improve these tasks. For this study, YOLOv8 Nano, a lightweight deep network, is chosen to classify the observed deficiencies in lettuce leaves. Several enhancements to the baseline algorithm are made, the backbone is replaced with VGG16 to improve the classification accuracy, and depthwise convolution is incorporated into it to enrich the features while keeping the head unchanged. The proposed network, incorporating these modifications, achieved superior classification results with a top-1 accuracy of 99%. This method outperformed other state-of-the-art classification methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in identifying lettuce deficiencies. The objective of this research was to improve the baseline algorithm to complete the classification task with a top-1 accuracy above 85%, a FLOP inferior to 10G, and classification latency below 170 ms per image.

Effect of Glutathione on the Destruction Kinetics of Silver Nanoparticles in Aqueous Solutions: An Optical Study under Neutral and Alkaline Conditions,"The interaction of nanostructured metal particles with the molecular components of biosystems differs significantly from the processes that take place in the presence of ions of the same metals. This unequivocally indicates the need to take into account not only the course of chemical processes but also implies to discuss certain physical effects that are usually neglected when considering such interactions. In this work, we studied the interaction of silver nanoparticle dispersion (Ag-NP) in ethylene glycol with a particle size less than 100 nm (Sigma-Aldrich 658804) with glutathione in a water and carbonate buffer (pH 10). The choice of glutathione (GSH) is due to the fact that it plays a significant role in intracellular processes, participating in the protection of intracellular components from the toxic effects of heavy metal ions; at the same time, differences in its interaction with silver ions and nanoparticles were experimentally demonstrated. A series of optical studies of the absorption and emission spectra of solutions of silver nanoparticles with GSH was carried out in order to establish the dominant processes in the system. It was shown that the above-mentioned silver nanoparticles in aqueous solutions spontaneously decompose over time, while glutathione differently affects these processes in water and carbonate buffer. It was shown that not only the local surface plasmon resonance bands but also the emission spectra of Ag-NP~GSH solutions in the region of 350–550 nm change with time. The sources of such radiation can be carbon quantum dots (CQD), which, according to published data, can be formed during the synthesis of silver nanoparticles and effectively luminesce in this region of the spectrum. Raman spectroscopy data confirm the presence of CQD in the Ag-NPs solution. The presence of quantum dots in the system makes it possible to indirectly track the presence of silver nanoparticles, which are booster centers, enhancing the emission of CQDs. The studies allow us to state that the interaction of glutathione with silver nanoparticles is a complex topochemical process in which, in addition to chemical reactions, the processes of transformation of silver nanoparticles and changes in the distribution of their sizes and chemical/physical functionality take place.

"Indoor Air Quality Assessment Using a Low-Cost Sensor: A Case Study in Ikere-Ekiti, Nigeria","Individuals who spend most of their time indoors are especially sensitive to indoor air quality (IAQ), which significantly impacts their general well-being and health. Traditional IAQ measurement techniques, however, are frequently pricy, complicated, and labor-intensive. In this study, we used a low-cost, simple-to-use, and handy sensor system to track the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10), temperature, and relative humidity (RH) in a laboratory at the Bamidele Olomilua University of Education, Science, and Technology in Ikere-Ekiti for a month. We contrasted the outcomes with other benchmarks and WHO recommendations. However, the NO2 levels (144.00–303.00 ppb) exceeded the suggested levels (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)—70 ppb; National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)—100 ppb; National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA)—120 ppb; and World Health Organization (WHO)—25 ppb), suggesting a possible cause of indoor contaminants. We also noticed that the temperature and humidity varied considerably throughout the day, which impacted the inhabitants’ thermal comfort and ventilation. The principal component analysis (PCA) findings indicate that particulate matter, the weather, photochemical reactions, and combustion processes are the key contributors to fluctuation in the air quality measurements. Based on their quantities and relationships, these elements can have a variety of effects on both the natural environment as well as well-being. Our monitoring device can give immediate information and warnings, assisting in locating and reducing indoor airborne pollutant sources and enhancing indoor air quality (IAQ). This work shows that adopting a low-cost sensor system for IAQ measurement in underdeveloped nations, where such data are sparse and frequently erroneous, is both feasible and beneficial.

Traffic Stream Characteristics Estimation Using In-Pavement Sensor Network,"The numbers of vehicles on the roads has increased tremendously. Also, the number of roads that are constantly experiencing traffic jams during morning and evening peak hours has increased significantly, which calls for a better understanding of traffic stream characteristics and car-following models. Traffic stream macroscopic parameters (speed, flow, and density) could be estimated through a number of traffic-flow theory models. In order to collect accurate data regarding fundamental of traffic stream parameters, a traffic monitoring system is needed to present the data from different roads. In this study, a real-time traffic monitoring system is introduced for traffic macroscopic parameters estimation. The sensor network has been constructed using a set of linear fiber optic sensors. In order to validate the system for this study, the system was installed at MnROAD facility, Minnesota. Fiber optic sensor detects the propagated strains in highway pavement due to the vehicle movements through the changes of the laser beam characteristics. Traffic flow can be estimated by tracking the peak of each axle passed over the sensor or within the sensitivity area, time mean speed (TMS), and space mean speed (SMS). SMS can be estimated by the different times a vehicle arrived at the sensors. The density can be determined either by using fundamental traffic flow theory model or estimating the time that vehicles occupy the sensor layout. Real traffic was used to validate the sensor layout. The results show the capability of the system to estimate traffic stream characteristics successfully.

Multi-Modal Human Action Segmentation Using Skeletal Video Ensembles,"Beyond traditional surveillance applications, sensor-based human action recognition and segmentation responds to a growing demand in the health and safety sector. Recently, skeletal action recognition has largely been dominated by spatio-temporal graph convolutional neural networks (ST-GCN), while video-based action segmentation research successfully employs 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs), as well as vision transformers. In this paper, we argue that these two inputs are complementary, and we develop an approach that achieves superior performance with a multi-modal ensemble. A multi-task GCN is developed that can predict both frame-wise actions as well as action timestamps, allowing for the use of fine-tuned video classification models to classify action segments and achieve refined predictions. Symmetrically, a multi-task video approach is presented that uses a video action segmentation model to predict framewise labels and timestamps, augmented with a skeletal action classification model. Finally, an ensemble of segmentation methods for each modality (skeletal, RGB, depth, and infrared) is formulated. Experimental results yield 87% accuracy on the PKU-MMD v2 dataset, delivering state-of-the-art performance.

Development of a Zigbee-Based Wireless Sensor Network of MEMS Accelerometers for Pavement Monitoring,"Safety related to pavement ageing is a major issue, as cracks and holes in the road surface can lead to severe accidents. Although pavement maintenance is extremely costly, detecting a deterioration before its surface becomes completely damaged remains a challenge. Current approaches still use wired sensors, which consume a lot of energy and are expensive; further to that, wired sensors may become damaged during installation. To avoid the use of cables, in this work, a prototype of a Zigbee-based wireless sensor network for pavement monitoring was developed and tested in the laboratory. The system consists of a slave sensor and a roadside unit; the slave sensor sends wireless acceleration data to the master, and the master saves the received acceleration dataset in a csv file. Further data processing can be performed in the master on this acceleration dataset. Two laboratory tests were performed for dynamic calibration and simulating five-axle truck pavement displacement. The preliminary results showed that the Zigbee-based wireless sensor network is capable of capturing the required ranges of displacement, acceleration, and frequency. The ADXL354 sensor was found to be the most appropriate accelerometer for this application, with as small as 155 uA power consumption.

Application of SERS Spectroscopy for the Study of Biological Molecules,"Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is a specialized spectroscopic technique based on the enhancement of the Raman scattering signals of molecules adsorbed or in close proximity to certain rough or nanostructured metal surfaces. It’s an extremely sensitive and powerful analytical tool for the investigation of biological molecules, revolutionizing the field of bioanalytical chemistry. The enhancement of Raman signal is due to various effects, the most important is thought to be the interaction between the electromagnetic wave associated with the laser used and the rough metal substrate (i.e., silver/copper/gold surfaces) on which the molecule is placed. When substrates are used, their characteristics are crucial for the reliability and sensitivity of experiments, as well as the ease of reproducibility of measurements. In the present work, we report on preliminary measurements to investigate the characteristics of two commercial SERS substrates, which have different nanostructures and patterns, properly designed to operate at an excitation wavelength of 785 nm. Aspirin C was used as a representative molecule to evaluate their application for SERS study of biological molecules, thanks to its characteristic fingerprint. Aspirin C is commercially available in the form of effervescent tablets, with acetylsalicylic acid and ascorbic acid as active principles with mainly analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. The results are discussed also considering future applications for the detection of analytes of environmental interest.

Semi-Supervised Adaptation for Skeletal-Data-Based Human Action Recognition,"Recent research on human action recognition is largely facilitated by skeletal data, a compact representation composed of key joints of the human body.

In the first phase, an unsupervised learning model is trained under a contrastive learning fashion to extract high-level human action semantic representations from an unlabeled source dataset. The resulting pretrained model is then fine-tuned on a small number of properly labeled data of the target environment. Experimentation is conducted on large-scale human action recognition datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Enhanced Pedestrian Dead Reckoning Sensor Fusion for Firefighting,"Knowing the exact position of firefighters in a building during an indoor firefighting operation is critical to improving the efficiency and safety of firefighters. For the estimation of an individual’s position in indoor or Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied environments, Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) is commonly used. PDR tries to estimate the required position via sensors without external references, for example, using accelerometers and gyroscopes. One of the most common techniques in PDR is step-detection. Applications like firefighting, however, also involve dynamic movements like crouching. Thus, the accuracy of a step-detection algorithm is reduced dramatically. Therefore, this paper presents a novel PDR algorithm that augments the conventional PDR technique with a tracking camera. The position estimates of a zero-crossing step-detection algorithm and tracking camera estimates are fused via a Kalman filter. A system prototype, designed for algorithm validation, is presented. The experimental results confirm that enhancing the system with a secondary sensor also leads to a substantial increase in the position estimation accuracy for dynamic crouching maneuvers compared to conventional step-detection algorithms.

Development of a Compact IoT-Enabled Device to Monitor Air Pollution for Environmental Sustainability,"Degrading air quality is a matter of concern nowadays, and monitoring air quality helps us keep an eye on it. Air pollution is a pressing global issue with far-reaching impacts on public health and the environment. The need for effective and real-time monitoring systems has become increasingly apparent to combat this growing concern. Here, an innovative air pollution surveillance system (APSS) that leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technology to enable comprehensive and dynamic air quality assessment is introduced. The proposed APMS employs a network of Io enabled sensors strategically deployed across urban and industrial areas. These sensors are equipped to measure various pollutants, including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Here, a regression model is created to forecast air quality using sensor data while taking into account variables including weather information, traffic patterns, and pollutants. Additionally, air quality categories (such as good, moderate, and harmful) are classified using classification algorithms based on preset thresholds. The IoT architecture facilitates seamless data transmission from these sensors to a centralized cloud-based platform. The developed APSS monitors the air quality using an MQ-135 gas sensor, and the data are shared over a web server using the Internet. An alarm will trigger when the air quality goes below a certain level. Also, the air quality, which is measured in parts per million (PPM), is displayed on the unit connected to it. Furthermore, when the PPM goes beyond a certain level, an alert message is sent to the air pollution control board, which takes preventive measures to control the pollution and also alerts the people, which helps each person in that society save their environment from pollution and have a good air quality environment. Additionally, the APSS offers user-friendly interfaces, accessible through web and mobile applications, to empower citizens with real-time air quality information. The effectiveness of the IoT-based air pollution monitoring system has been validated through successful field trials in urban and industrial environments, and it has the ability to provide real-time data insights and empower stakeholders in promoting environmental sustainability and fostering citizen engagement.

Celestial Body Surface Mapping for Resource Discovery Using Satellites,"Exploring the solar system provides new possibilities for the survival and development of humankind. Although we do not yet have the technology to migrate on a large scale, we must first find proper celestial bodies, understand their environment, and utilize them. In the future, with highly developed space technology, planets and natural satellites will become “islands” in the solar system for human settlements. However, the lack of information on this matter is one of the greatest challenges in this field.

Design and Development of a Low-Cost and Compact Real-Time Monitoring Tool for Battery Life Calculation,"Lithium-ion batteries are utilized everywhere from electronic equipment, smartphones and laptops to electric vehicles; however, certain disadvantages are inherited including high-cost and low-temperature range, caused by high currents. In this paper, a compact and low-cost battery management system is presented which can measure the voltage and current for both the battery and power supply. Two NTC thermistors, 10k and 100K Ohm each, are exploited for collecting battery temperature in two different spots of the socket for direct comparison and validation while an additional sensor measures external temperature and humidity. A charging socket is provided for charging the cell through an external source with dynamic voltage output to test the battery response.

"LoRa Radius Coverage Map on Urban and Rural Areas: Case Study of Athens’ Northern Suburbs and Tinos Island, Greece","As the use and development of Internet of Things is very popular nowadays, one of the most widespread ways of exchanging data from such arrangements is the use of the LoRa network. One of the advantages offered by this technology is the ability to provide low power consumption as well as wide wireless coverage in an area. Although in research, there are references regarding the coverage radius of a geographical area, differences can be detected between urban (cities) and rural (countryside) areas, as in the latter, there are no dense structures nor radio signal noise inside the operating frequency spectrum of LoRa. Thus, results are expected to be better in rural areas than urban areas. Especially in an urban area, apart from the signal noise caused by other LoRa devices (either commercial or private), the coverage varies according to the placement of the LoRa station inside a building, which is related to the height at which the gateway is placed in another building. In this work, the LoRa radio coverage study is presented in a radius of 2 km both in an urban and a rural environment using only one LoRa gateway. To better capture the coverage, LoRa stations are placed on every floor of the selected buildings periodically. The results show the difference in coverage between urban and rural areas which is related to radio signal noise. Furthermore, significant changes in the coverage map in urban areas can be observed, directly related to the installation height of the LoRa station. With the understanding of these variations in LoRa network performance in different environments, informed decisions can be made regarding the deployment of such networks, optimizing their efficiency and ensuring seamless data transmission in both urban and rural settings.

Devising an Internet of Things-Based Healthcare Medical Container for the Transportation of Organs and Healthcare Products Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Every second counts when a patient who requires an organ transplant is finally matched with a donor. The organ’s post-transplant performance declines with the increasing time between the organ’s removal and transplantation into the recipient. Organs must be transported from point A to B as quickly and safely as possible to improve the chances of success. In addition to delivering medical goods or vaccines to hard-to-reach places, drones can help us to save lives across the world, but there, are some issues to address, one of which is maintaining container temperature and humidity and monitoring it. Further, drones carrying medical containers flying at different altitudes causes temperature changes, which may affect the organs. To tackle such difficulties, in this work a smart container embedded with a Peltier module (thermoelectric cooler) and a temperature sensor has been developed to maintain the temperature thereby providing safety for healthcare products or organs. Further, the relay module is utilized to control the Peltier module and ESP8266 WIFI Microcontroller (MCU) which also enables the user to send live data to the cloud and also allows the user to monitor and control the temperature remotely.

Texture Classification Based on Sound and Vibro-Tactile Data,"This paper focuses on the development and validation of an automatic learning system for the classification of tactile data in form of vibro-tactile (accelerometer) and audio (microphone) data for texture recognition. A novel combination of features including the standard deviation, the mean, the absolute median of the deviation, the energy that characterizes the power of the signal, a measure that reflects the perceptual properties of the human system associated with each sensory modality, and the Fourier characteristics extracted from signals, along with principal component analysis, is shown to obtain the best results. Several machine learning models are compared in an attempt to identify the best compromise between the number of features, the classification performance and the computation time. Longer sampling periods (2 s. vs. 1 s) provide more information for classification, leading to higher performance (average of 3.59%) but also augment the evaluation time by an average of 29.48% over all features and models. For the selected dataset, the XGBRF model was identified to represent overall the best compromise between performance and computation time for the proposed novel combination of features over all material types with an F-score of 0.91 and a computation time of 4.69 ms, while kNN represents the next best option (1% improvement in performance at the cost of 2.13 ms increase in time with respect to XGBRF).

Design and Development of Internet of Things-Based Smart Sensors for Monitoring Agricultural Lands,"In recent years, the demand for efficient and sustainable agricultural practices has been leveraged, leading to smart farming practices. These practices aim to enhance agricultural processes and productivity and minimize resource waste. One of the crucial challenges faced by farmers is the uneven distribution of soil humidity and pH across their agricultural lands. Further, the irregularity in soil moisture content and pH can lead to poor crop performance, water wastage, and increased resource utilization. In this work, an Internet of Things-based smart sensor node was developed, which consists of humidity and pH sensors to ensure the efficient management of water and soil conditions across an entire farm. Also, an array of humidity and pH sensors were placed across the farm, and these units worked independently as they have their own controller and battery unit. The developed device was integrated with a solar cell, which charged the battery. Further, the data acquired from these sensors were wirelessly transmitted to the base station, and it gathered the information of each unit, including their humidity levels, pH values, signal strength, and energy supply. This information was processed at the base station, and a graphical overview of the farm with the acquired information was represented, which provides farmers with real-view insight to identify areas with poor humidity and pH conditions. These data were transmitted to an IoT cloud, offering the farmer the ability to monitor their farm from a remote location. In cases where humidity levels dropped drastically and remained unchecked for more than two hours, the system triggered an alert. This mechanism makes sure that farmers are notified of potential issues, allowing them to prevent crop damage and optimize their resource usage.

Sheathless Dielectrophoresis-Based Microfluidic Chip for Label-Free Bio-Particle Focusing and Separation,"This paper presents a novel microfluidic dielectrophoresis (DEP) system to focus and separate cells of similar size based on their structural differences, which is more challenging than separation by size. Because, in this case, the DEP force is only proportional to the polarizabilities of cells, we used live and dead yeast cells as bio-particles to investigate the chip efficiency. Our designed chip consists of three sections. First, we focused on cells at the center of the microchannel by employing a negative DEP phenomenon. After that, cells were separated due to the different deflection from high-electric-field areas. Finally, a novel outlet design was utilized to facilitate separation by increasing the gap between the two groups of cells. The proposed sheath-free design has one inlet for target cell injection requiring only one pump to control the flow rate, which reduces costs and complexity. Successful discrimination of the particles was achieved by using DEP force as a label-free and highly efficient technique. As an accessible and cost-effective method, soft lithography with a 3D-printed resin mold was used to fabricate the microfluidic parts. The microchannel was made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) material that is biocompatible. The electrodes were made of gold due to its biocompatibility and non-oxidation, and a titanium layer was sputtered as the buffer layer for the adhesion of the sputtered gold layer to the glass. A standard microfabrication process was employed to create the electrode pattern. O2 plasma treatment yielded leakage-free bonding between the patterned glass and PDMS structure containing the microfluidic channel. The maximum voltage applied to the electrodes (26 V) was lower than the threshold value for cell electroporation. The simulations and experimental results both confirm the effectiveness of the proposed microfluidic chip.

Golomb–Rice Coder-Based Hybrid Electrocardiogram Compression System,"Heart-related ailments have become a significant cause of death around the globe in recent years. Due to lifestyle changes, people of almost all age brackets face these issues. Preventing and treating heart-related issues require the electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring of patients. The study of patients’ ECG signals helps doctors identify abnormal heart rhythm patterns by which screening problems like arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm), myocardial infarction (heart attacks), and myocarditis (heart inflammation) is possible. The need for 24 h heart rate monitoring has led to the development of wearable devices, and the constant monitoring of ECG data leads to the generation of a large amount of data since wearable systems are resource-constrained regarding energy, memory, size, and computing capabilities. The optimization of biomedical monitoring systems is required to increase their efficiency. This paper presents an ECG compression system to reduce the amount of data generated, which reduces the energy consumption in the transceiver, which is a significant part of the overall energy consumed. The proposed system uses hybrid Golomb–Rice coding for data compression, a lossless data compression technique. The data compression is performed on the MIT BIH arrhythmia database; the achieved compression ratio of the compression system is 2.75 and 3.14 for average and maximum values, which, compared to the raw ECG samples, requires less transmission cost in terms of power consumed.

Investigation of Rectifier Responses Affecting Operational Bandwidth in an Electromagnetic Vibration Energy Harvester,"Energy harvesters provide excellent solutions for the power supply problem of wireless sensor nodes (WSNs), and energy harvesters with a wider bandwidth will clearly better serve WSNs and assist in the construction of Industry 4.0. However, the bearing of rectifiers on the load bandwidth of energy harvesters has rarely been investigated. This paper focuses on the impact of diverse rectifiers on the load electrical response of an electromagnetic energy harvester in the sweep mode of experiments, especially on the load bandwidth. The rectifiers were set as a half-wave rectifier and a full-bridge rectifier, respectively, and two different rectifier diodes were adopted in the experiment. The experimental results suggest that the half-wave rectifier exhibited certain advantages especially in the bandwidth field. If a full-bridge rectifier using high-speed switching diodes is replaced with a half-wave rectifier using Schottky diodes under the load resistance of 100 Ω, the load bandwidth will increase by almost 1.9 times. A preliminary analysis of the experimental results is provided at length.

Intelligent Interplanetary Satellite Communication Network for the Exploration of Celestial Bodies,"Recently, a significant interest in space exploration has emerged, driven by the lack of resources and the quest for answers to issues like climate change. New technologies give us the possibility of exploring our solar system and its surroundings in greater detail. But current space communications operate with a lack of efficiency due to the vast distances between celestial bodies within our solar system. Also, factors such as bandwidth asymmetry contribute to disruptions in the satellite communication network. This paper proposes the definition of the infrastructure of an interplanetary communication network, built upon a communications protocol featuring dynamic routing. This infrastructure aims to optimize information transmission by adapting communications to surrounding conditions. The envisioned infrastructure involves strategically placing network nodes at key Lagrange points around each planet within the asteroid belt. The nodes will be aware of their position, integrating sensing capabilities and intelligent algorithms. Next to each planet, a node with more capabilities will collect information from nanosatellites orbiting a planet and relay the information back to Earth. This structure will allow decision-making processes based on exploration data of the most significant celestial bodies within the asteroid belt, providing valuable insights such as constant monitoring of the dark side of the moon and difficult-to-reach zones in the solar system.

Optimizable Ensemble Regression for Arousal and Valence Predictions from Visual Features,"The cognitive state of a person can be categorized using the Circumplex model of emotional states, a continuous model of two dimensions: arousal and valence. We exploit the Remote Collaborative and Affective Interactions (RECOLA) database, which includes audio, video, and physiological recordings of interactions between human participants to predict arousal and valance values using machine learning techniques. To allow learners to focus on the most relevant data, features are extracted from raw data. Such features can be predesigned or learned. Learned features are automatically learned and utilized by deep learning solutions. Predesigned features are calculated before machine learning and inputted into the learner. Our previous work on video recordings focused on learned features. In this paper, we expand our work onto predesigned visual features, extracted from video recordings. We process these features by applying time delay and sequencing, arousal/valence labelling, and shuffling and splitting. We then train and test regressors to predict arousal and valence values. Our results outperform those from the literature. We achieve a root mean squared error (RMSE), Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC), and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.1033, 0.8498, and 0.8001 on arousal predictions; and 0.07016, 0.8473, and 0.8053 on valence predictions, using an optimizable ensemble, respectively.

"Distribution of Natural Radionuclides in Ama Fatma Oil Shale, Morocco","The present work aims to analyze the distribution of radionuclides naturally occurring in the oil shale of the Ama Fatma coastal zone. For this purpose, using gamma-ray spectrometry, we analyzed the activity concentrations of uranium (U), thorium (Th) series, and potassium-40 (K-40) in oil shale samples retrieved from the study area. The concentrations of U-238 ranged from 45 ± 36 to 194 ± 50 Bq.kg−1 and those of Th-232 fluctuated between 1.48 ± 0.92 and 9.47 ± 1.06 Bq.kg−1. The measured concentrations for Ra-226, Pb-214, and K-40 oscillated between 33 ± 5 and 138 ± 9 Bq.kg−1, 18 ± 1 and 68 ± 3 Bq.kg−1, and between 17 ± 4 and 279 ± 16 Bq.kg−1, respectively. The obtained values variation appears to be related to the deposit nature and assimilation processes of appropriate radionuclides rather than the retrieved samples’ related depth. The analysis of 232Th/238U and 226Ra/238U allowed an understanding of these radionuclides’ behaviors. The ratios 226Ra/238U ranged from 0.56 to 0.74 with a mean value of 0.70 which indicates the existence of disequilibrium in the investigated oil shale samples. This disequilibrium can be attributed to significant differences in the mobility of these radionuclides.

Preparation and Characterization of Plant Extract-Loaded PVA/GO Nanocomposite Films for Food Packaging,"Antibacterial agents produced from plant extracts are seen as a promising application in food packaging. Essential oil extracts, on the other hand, often have drawbacks such as long-term instability, limited bioavailability, and fast burst release. This study’s primary goal was to develop poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposite films for use in food packaging, utilizing moringa (M) and guava (G) leaf extracts. The characteristics of polymer films were enhanced by adding a small quantity of GO as a reinforcing filler, and then adding phenolic and flavonoid compounds as antibacterial agents. First, GO and plant extracts were dispersed through the use of ultrasonication. Next, all chemicals were introduced in the PVA matrix with the use of a straightforward and eco-friendly solution casting approach. Water was used as the solvent for this process. As a consequence of these findings, PVA/GO/M3% films demonstrated superior tensile strength (73.63 MPa), % elongation at break (641.94%), and modulus (23.84 MPa) in comparison to neat PVA films. The GO was an effective reinforcing filler, while phenolic and flavonoid compounds were, respectively, crystallization agents. They were distributed randomly in the PVA matrix with no preferred orientation and some agglomeration. Furthermore, the antibacterial activity of the synthetic films loaded with M and G leaf extracts was low when tested against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus).

Intelligent Sensing and Control System for Real-Time Graded Load Shedding,"A power shortage is a common case prevailing in today’s power scenario. Load shedding occurs when the demand power is greater than the generation power; then, the excessive load is cut to avoid power shortage. Usually, load shedding will make use of complex circuitry and systems along with expensive materials. This necessitates the need for a simple and efficient solution that meets all the requirements. The intelligent system is created with the help of microcontrollers achieving real-time load shedding. The power limit in the system is obtained from the utility company. The measured value in the system is obtained from the sensor and the value is compared to the power limit. If it is within the limit, no action is taken. When the limit exceeds the calculated value, the power supply is cut off. Graded load shedding is achieved through the above-mentioned method.

Comparison of Inductive Thermography and Computer Tomography Results for Short Surface Cracks,"Inductive thermography is a non-destructive testing method, whereby the workpiece to be inspected is slightly heated by a short inductive heating pulse. An infrared camera records the surface temperature during and after the heating pulse. As defects influence the induced eddy current distribution and the heat flow, they become highly visible in the evaluated infrared images. The deeper a crack is, the greater the obstacle it represents. In Inconel welded samples, short surface cracks (length 0.3–2 mm) were created using a so-called Varestraint test machine. The samples were inspected via inductive thermography and computer tomography (CT). Additional finite element simulations were calculated in order to model the thermography experiments. The comparison of the thermographic, CT and simulation results shows how the thermographic signal of a defect depends on its geometry. This information can be used for calibration to estimate the crack properties based on the thermographic inspection.

A Novel MPPT-Based Solar Irradiance Estimator: Integration of a Hybrid Incremental Conductance Integral Backstepping Algorithm for PV Systems with Experimental Validation,"This paper outlines the development of a high-performance maximum power point tracking (MPPT)-based solar irradiance estimator for photovoltaic (PV) systems. The suggested estimator is constructed around a simple current–voltage-based algebraic equation that hinges on the operation of the PV system at its maximum power point (MPP). In the realm of MPP operation, the overall system is driven by a nonlinear MPPT controller. To achieve this function, we integrated a hybrid incremental conductance integral backstepping (H-INC-IBS) controller to effectively regulate the PV system. This controller was specially chosen for its powerful potency in maximizing the dynamics of the PV system, leading to heightened robustness against changing environmental conditions. The simulation results are provided to showcase the suitability of the proposed estimator. Furthermore, the estimator was verified under experimental conditions, highlighting its soundness and practicality. Through evaluations and comparisons with the conventional irradiance estimator, this paper aimed to emphasize the superiority of the proposed solar irradiance estimator in providing more accurate estimations of solar irradiance for PV systems operating under MPPT supervision.

Contextualizing the Smart City in Africa: Balancing Human-Centered and Techno-Centric Perspectives for Smart Urban Performance,"The continuous growth of urban populations and the complexities of their current management in Africa have driven local governments to explore new technologies to optimize their urban and territorial performance. These governments and related stakeholders’ resort to the term “smart city” to orient the current urban planning policies and practices to be more efficient and adequate. Nevertheless, the issue that remains is how to contextualize this global term that has not yet been fully adopted by African cities that have claimed to be “Smart”. This contextualization becomes more complex in this critical context, where the city has not yet reached an ideal performance. Therefore, to reach this prospective African smart city, a critical review of how it would be both human-centered and techno-centered is imperative. This paper would review accordingly the above argument and set key performance indicator-based methodology on how to evaluate the smartness of a city in the African context.

Edge Offloading in Smart Grid,"The management of decentralized energy resources and smart grids needs novel data-driven low-latency applications and services to improve resilience and responsiveness and ensure closer to real-time control. However, the large-scale integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to the generation of significant amounts of data at the edge of the grid, posing challenges for the traditional cloud-based smart-grid architectures to meet the stringent latency and response time requirements of emerging applications. In this paper, we delve into the energy grid and computational distribution architectures, including edge–fog–cloud models, computational orchestration, and smart-grid frameworks to support the design and offloading of grid applications across the computational continuum. Key factors influencing the offloading process, such as network performance, data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) processes, computational requirements, application-specific factors, and energy efficiency, are analyzed considering the smart-grid operational requirements. We conduct a comprehensive overview of the current research landscape to support decision-making regarding offloading strategies from cloud to fog or edge. The focus is on metaheuristics for identifying near-optimal solutions and reinforcement learning for adaptively optimizing the process. A macro perspective on determining when and what to offload in the smart grid is provided for the next-generation AI applications, offering an overview of the features and trade-offs for selecting between federated learning and edge AI solutions. Finally, the work contributes to a comprehensive understanding of edge offloading in smart grids, providing a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis to support cost–benefit analysis in decision-making regarding offloading strategies.

Flood-Resilient Smart Cities: A Data-Driven Risk Assessment Approach Based on Geographical Risks and Emergency Response Infrastructure,"Flooding in urban areas is expected to become even more common due to climatic changes, putting pressure on cities to implement effective response measures. Practical mechanisms for assessing flood risk have become highly desired, but existing solutions have been devoted to evaluating only specific cities and consider only limited risk perspectives, constraining their general applicability. This article presents an innovative approach for assessing the flood risk of delimited urban areas by exploiting geospatial information from publicly available databases, providing a method that is applicable to any city in the world and requiring minimum configurations. A set of mathematical equations is defined for numerically assessing risk levels based on elevation, slope, and proximity to rivers, while the existence of emergency-related urban infrastructure is considered as a risk reduction factor. Then, computed risk levels are used to classify areas, allowing easy visualisation of flood risk for a city. This smart city approach not only serves as a valuable tool for assessing the expected flood risk based on different parameters but also facilitates the implementation of cutting-edge strategies to effectively mitigate critical situations, ultimately enhancing urban resilience to flood-related disaster.

Urban Design and Planning Participation in the Digital Age: Lessons from an Experimental Online Platform,"There is increasing use of digital technologies in urban planning, including in the generation of designs and the participative side of planning. We examine this digital planning by reporting on the application of an experimental online participatory platform in the regeneration of a London housing estate, enabling reflection on participation processes and outcomes. Drawing on lessons learned, the paper synthesises a conceptual representation of online participation and a relational framework for understanding the participatory platform and its context. We subsequently develop a ‘matrix of participative space’, building on Arnstein’s ‘ladder of participation’, to present a two-dimensional framework of online participation, identifying cases of ‘participative deficit’ and ‘democratic deficit’. We conclude with implications for future digital participation in urban planning and design.

Climate Change Mitigation through Modular Construction,"Modular construction (MC) is a promising concept with the potential to revolutionize the construction industry (CI). The sustainability aspects of MC, among its other encouraging facets, have garnered escalated interest and acclaim among the research community, especially in the context of climate change (CC) mitigation efforts. Despite numerous scholarly studies contributing to the understanding of MC, a holistic review of the prevailing literature that systematically documents the impact of utilizing MC on CC mitigation remains scarce. The study conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) of the pertinent literature retrieved from the Scopus repository to explore the relationship between MC and CC mitigation. Employing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, the SLR was conducted on 31 shortlisted articles published between 2010 and 2023. The findings of the study reveal that MC can mitigate the climate crisis by reducing GHG emissions, curtailing resource intensiveness by enabling a circular economy (CE), fomenting energy efficiency, and fostering resourceful land use and management in the CI. A conceptual framework based on the findings of the previous literature is proposed in this study, which outlines several strategies for CC mitigation that can be implemented by the adoption of MC in the CI. The current study is a humble effort to review various offerings of MC to help mitigate CC in the era of striving for global sustainability. For industry practitioners and policymakers, this study highlights the viability of leveraging MC for CC mitigation, aiming to inspire better decision making for sustainable development in the CI.

Enhancing Smart Cities through Third-Party Logistics: Predicting Delivery Intensity,"This article addresses the key and current issues of smart cities in the context of last-mile supply management. Specifically, it explores how third-party logistics (3PL) activities impact last-mile delivery management in smart cities. It examines how 3PL affects delivery volumes, expanding the predictive capabilities of logistics operators. A research question included in the Introduction of this paper is also posed to explore the problem in depth. The research conducted focuses mainly on a case study conducted on the operations of an international 3PL logistics operator. In addition, predictive methods are used to analyse the shipment volume data for individual barcodes in the two analysed cities in Poland. Currently, the concept of a smart city assumes the limited participation of logistics operators in creating improvements for cities. The case study analysis shows that in the cities studied, 3PL companies, through predictive actions, can regulate the flow of vehicles out of the logistics centre and into the city, thus influencing the traffic volume in the city. The research is limited to two cities in Poland implementing smart city solutions and one logistics operator. The research also does not include e-commerce. The authors acknowledge that the results obtained cannot be generalised to a larger scale. This paper bridges the research gap on 3PL activities for last-mile logistics improvements. In addition, the paper proposes the first concept related to the implementation of a 3PL company’s predictive activities associated with the operator’s ability to control the impact on urban traffic.

Safety and Mobility Evaluation of Cumulative-Anticipative Car-Following Model for Connected Autonomous Vehicles,"In the typical landscape of road transportation, about 90% of traffic accidents result from human errors. Vehicle automation enhances road safety by reducing driver fatigue and errors and improves overall mobility efficiency. The advancement of autonomous vehicle technology will significantly impact traffic safety, potentially saving more than 30,000 lives annually in the United States alone. The widespread acceptance of autonomous and connected autonomous vehicles (AVs and CAVs) will be a process spanning multiple decades, requiring their coexistence with traditional vehicles. This study explores the mobility and safety performance of CAVs in mixed-traffic environments using the cumulative-anticipative car-following (CACF) model. This research compares the CACF model with established Wiedemann 99 and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) models using a VISSIM platform. The simulations include single-lane and multi-lane networks, incorporating sensitivity tests for mobility and safety parameters. The study reveals increased throughput, reduced delays, and enhanced travel times with CACF, emphasizing its advantages over CACC. Safety analyses demonstrate CACF’s ability to prevent traffic shockwaves and bottlenecks, emphasizing the significance of communication range and acceleration coefficients. The research recommends early investment in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication technology, refining CACC logic, and expanding the study to diverse road scenarios.

An Artificial Intelligence and Industrial Internet of Things-Based Framework for Sustainable Hydropower Plant Operations,"Hydropower plays a crucial role in supplying electricity to developed nations and is projected to expand its capacity in various developing countries such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Argentina, Colombia, and Turkey. With the increasing demand for sustainable energy and the emphasis on reducing carbon emissions, the significance of hydropower plants is growing. Nevertheless, numerous challenges arise for these plants due to their aging infrastructure, impacting both their efficiency and structural stability. In order to tackle these issues, the present study has formulated a specialized real-time framework for identifying damage, with a particular focus on detecting corrosion in the conductors of generators within hydropower plants. It should be noted that corrosion processes can be highly complex and nonlinear, making it challenging to develop accurate physics-based models that capture all the nuances. Therefore, the proposed framework leverages autoencoder, an unsupervised, data-driven AI technology with the Mahalanobis distance, to capture the intricacies of corrosion and automate its detection. Rigorous testing shows that it can identify slight variations indicating conductor corrosion with over 80% sensitivity and a 5% false alarm rate for ‘medium’ to ‘high’ severity damage. By detecting and resolving corrosion early, the system reduces disruptions, streamlines maintenance, and mitigates unscheduled repairs’ negative effects on the environment. This enhances energy generation effectiveness, promotes hydroelectric facilities’ long-term viability, and fosters community prosperity.

The Cybersecurity Applied by Online Travel Agencies and Hotels to Protect Users’ Private Data in Smart Cities,"The purpose of this paper is to analyse the cybersecurity in online travel agencies (OTAs) and hotel sectors to protect users’ private data in smart cities. Methodologically, this research uses a sample of information about cyberattacks that occurred during the period of 2000–2023 in companies operating as OTAs and in the travel, tourism, and food sectors, which was obtained from research articles. Then, we had to expand the research to include updated information about cyberattacks from digital newspapers, regulatory sources, and state data breach notification sites like CSIS, KonBriefing, EUROCONTROL, and GlobalData. The findings of the current research prove that hotels and OTAs were constantly exposed to cyberattacks in the period analysed, especially by data breaches and malware attacks; in fact, this is the main novelty of this research. In addition, these incidents were severe for both guests and tourism companies because their vulnerabilities and consequences affect the reputation of companies and smart cities where these firms operate, as well as consumer confidence. The results also showed that most of the cyberattacks examined in this manuscript were aimed at stealing information about the companies’ and users’ private data such as email addresses; credit card numbers, security codes, and expiration dates; and encoded magstripe data; among many other types of data. Cyberattacks and cyberthreats never disappear completely in the travel and tourism sectors because these illegal activities are closely related to the hacker’s thirst for power, fame, and wealth.

Predicting Autonomous Driving Behavior through Human Factor Considerations in Safety-Critical Events,"This paper investigates the ability of autonomous driving systems to predict outcomes by considering human factors like gender, age, and driving experience, particularly in the context of safety-critical events. The primary objective is to equip autonomous vehicles with the capacity to make plausible deductions, handle conflicting data, and adjust their responses in real-time during safety-critical situations. A foundational dataset, which encompasses various driving scenarios such as lane changes, merging, and navigating complex intersections, is employed to enable vehicles to exhibit appropriate behavior and make sound decisions in critical safety events. The deep learning model incorporates personalized cognitive agents for each driver, considering their distinct preferences, characteristics, and requirements. This personalized approach aims to enhance the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving, contributing to the ongoing development of intelligent transportation systems. The efforts made contribute to advancements in safety, efficiency, and overall performance within autonomous driving systems. To describe the causal relationship between external factors like weather conditions and human factors, and safety-critical driver behaviors, various data mining techniques can be applied. One commonly used method is regression analysis. Additionally, correlation analysis is employed to reveal relationships between different factors, helping to identify the strength and direction of their impact on safety-critical driver behavior.

Engaging Young People in the Development of Innovative Nature-Inspired Technologies for Carbon Sequestration in Cities: Case Studies from Portugal,"Currently, cities are the most vulnerable places on the planet to the effects of global change, both anthropogenic and climate-related, and this is not compatible with harmony and well-being regarding the economy, nature, and future generations. Young people have a unique potential to catalyze the transformative sustainable change that the planet needs now, as they are the first generation to grow up with tangible impacts of climate change. We tested a new strategy to empower young people to foster carbon neutrality in cities by engaging them in ecosystem services quantification and technological innovation to increase CO2 sequestration in two Portuguese cities. The species with best performance for carbon sequestration were M. exelsa in Porto and O. europea in Loulé, and for air pollutant removal and hydrological regulation were P. hispanica in Porto and P. pinea in Loulé. Through the innovative advanced summer program SLI, a nature-based learning experience, young people developed two new concepts of technological solutions to accelerate city decarbonization by designing a hedge for air pollution hotspots and a biodevice to be placed at bus stops using autochthonous shrubs and mosses. Initiatives like SLI contribute to a greater awareness among young people about the drivers that brought us to the current climate emergency, motivating them towards more balanced lifestyles and creating innovative nature-based solutions towards a smart and sustainable city.

Smart Cities and Urban Energy Planning: An Advanced Review of Promises and Challenges,"This review explores the relationship between urban energy planning and smart city evolution, addressing three primary questions: How has research on smart cities and urban energy planning evolved in the past thirty years? What promises and hurdles do smart city initiatives introduce to urban energy planning? And why do some smart city projects surpass energy efficiency and emission reduction targets while others fall short? Based on a bibliometric analysis of 9320 papers published between January 1992 and May 2023, five dimensions were identified by researchers trying to address these three questions: (1) energy use at the building scale, (2) urban design and planning integration, (3) transportation and mobility, (4) grid modernization and smart grids, and (5) policy and regulatory frameworks. A comprehensive review of 193 papers discovered that previous research prioritized technological advancements in the first four dimensions. However, there was a notable gap in adequately addressing the inherent policy and regulatory challenges. This gap often led to smart city endeavors underperforming relative to their intended objectives. Overcoming the gap requires a better understanding of broader issues such as environmental impacts, social justice, resilience, safety and security, and the affordability of such initiatives.

On the Adoption of Smart Home Technology in Switzerland: Results from a Survey Study Focusing on Prevention and Active Healthy Aging Aspects,"Smart home (SH) technologies offer advancements in comfort, energy management, health, and safety. There is increasing interest in technology-enabled home services from scholars and professionals, particularly to meet the needs of a growing aging population. Yet, current research focuses on assisted living scenarios developed for elderly individuals with health impairments, and neglects to explore the potential of SHs in prevention. We aim to improve comprehension and guide future research on the value of SH technology for risk prevention with a survey assessing the adoption of SHs by older adults based on novel ad hoc collected data. Our survey is based on the theoretical background derived from the extant body of literature. In addition to established adoption factors and user characteristics, it includes previously unexamined elements such as active and healthy aging parameters, risk and insurance considerations, and social and hedonic dimensions. Descriptive results and regression analyses indicate that a vast majority of individuals acknowledge the preventive benefits of SHs. Additionally, we observe that individuals with higher levels of social activity, technology affinity, and knowledge of SHs tend to report greater interest. Moreover, perceived enjoyment and perceived risk emerge as central elements for SH adoption. Our research indicates that considering lifestyle factors when examining technology adoption and emphasizing the preventive benefits present possibilities for both future studies and practical implementations.

"Benchmarking the Functional, Technical, and Business Characteristics of Automated Passenger Counting Products","Urban transport planning and the integration of various mobility options have become increasingly complex, necessitating a thorough understanding of user mobility patterns and their diverse needs. This paper focuses on benchmarking different Automatic Passenger Counting (APC) technologies, which play a key role in Mobility as a Service (MaaS) systems. APC systems provide valuable data for analysing mobility patterns and informing decisions about resource allocation. Our study presents a comprehensive data collection and benchmark analysis of APC solutions. The literature review emphasises the significance of passenger counting for transport companies and discusses various existing APC technologies, such as pressure sensors, wireless sensors, optical infrared sensors (IR), and video image technology. Real-world applications of APC systems are examined, highlighting experimental results and their potential for improving accuracy. The methodology outlines the data collection process, which involved identifying APC companies, conducting interviews with companies and customers, and administering an ad hoc survey to gather specific information about APC systems. The collected data were used to establish criteria and key performance indicators (KPIs) for the benchmarking analysis. The benchmarking analysis compares APC devices and companies based on ten criteria: technology, accuracy, environment, coverage, interface, interference, robustness (for devices), price, pricing model, and system integration (for companies). KPIs were developed to measure performance and make comparison easier. The results of the benchmarking analysis offer insights into the costs and accuracy of different APC systems, enabling informed decision making regarding system selection and implementation. The findings fill a research gap and provide valuable information for transport companies and policy makers, and we offer a comprehensive analysis of APC systems, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and business strategies.

Sensors in Civil Engineering: From Existing Gaps to Quantum Opportunities,"The vital role of civil engineering is to enable the development of modern cities and establish foundations for smart and sustainable urban environments of the future. Advanced sensing technologies are among the instrumental methods used to enhance the performance of civil engineering infrastructures and address the multifaceted challenges of future cities. Through this study, we discussed the shortcomings of traditional sensors in four primary civil engineering domains: construction, energy, water, and transportation. Then, we investigated and summarized the potential of quantum sensors to contribute to and revolutionize the management of civil engineering infrastructures. For the water sector, advancements are expected in monitoring water quality and pressure in water and sewage infrastructures. In the energy sector, quantum sensors may facilitate renewables integration and improve grid stability and buildings’ energy efficiency. The most promising progress in the construction field is the ability to identify subsurface density and underground structures.

Efficient Decoder and Intermediate Domain for Semantic Segmentation in Adverse Conditions,"In smart city contexts, traditional methods for semantic segmentation are affected by adverse conditions, such as rain, fog, or darkness. One challenge is the limited availability of semantic segmentation datasets, specifically for autonomous driving in adverse conditions, and the high cost of labeling such datasets. To address this problem, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is commonly employed. In UDA, the source domain contains data from good weather conditions, while the target domain contains data from adverse weather conditions. The Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC) provides reference images taken at different times but in the same location, which can serve as an intermediate domain, offering additional semantic information. In this study, we introduce a method that leverages both the intermediate domain and frequency information to improve semantic segmentation in smart city environments. Specifically, we extract the region with the largest difference in standard deviation and entropy values from the reference image as the intermediate domain. Secondly, we introduce the Fourier Exponential Decreasing Sampling (FEDS) algorithm to facilitate more reasonable learning of frequency domain information. Finally, we design an efficient decoder network that outperforms the DAFormer network by reducing network parameters by 28.00%. When compared to the DAFormer work, our proposed approach demonstrates significant performance improvements, increasing by 6.77%, 5.34%, 6.36%, and 5.93% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for Cityscapes to ACDC night, foggy, rainy, and snowy, respectively.

Urban Traffic Congestion Prediction: A Multi-Step Approach Utilizing Sensor Data and Weather Information,"The continuous growth of urban populations has led to the persistent problem of traffic congestion, which imposes adverse effects on quality of life, such as commute times, road safety, and the local air quality. Advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) sensor technology have contributed to a plethora of new data streams regarding traffic conditions. Therefore, the recognition and prediction of traffic congestion patterns utilizing such data have become crucial. To that end, the integration of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can further enhance Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), contributing to the smart management of transportation systems and effectively tackling traffic congestion in cities. This study seeks to assess a wide range of models as potential solutions for an ML-based multi-step forecasting approach intended to improve traffic congestion prediction, particularly in areas with limited historical data. Various interpretable predictive algorithms, suitable for handling the complexity and spatiotemporal characteristics of urban traffic flow, were tested and eventually shortlisted based on their predictive performance. The forecasting approach selects the optimal model in each step to maximize the accuracy. The findings demonstrate that, in a 24 h step prediction, variating Ensemble Tree-Based (ETB) regressors like the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) exhibit superior performances compared to traditional Deep Learning (DL) methods. Our work provides a valuable contribution to short-term traffic congestion predictions and can enable more efficient scheduling of daily urban transportation.

Fit Islands: Designing a Multifunctional Virtual Urban Community to Promote Healthy Aging for Chinese Older Adults,"Within the context of an aging global population, the demographic structure of emerging economies is undergoing a dramatic transformation. Emerging economies have a large population base and rapid economic development, but they are ill-prepared to deal with population aging. Limited resources force many older adults to face health issues such as chronic diseases and loss of physical independence, exacerbating the burden of traditional family and societal elderly care. Uncontrollable events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and regional conflicts have exacerbated the plight of older adults. Improving the quality of life and health of older adults has become a development priority in emerging economies in the face of a rapidly aging population. The development of smart cities has brought with it many available digital technologies, and the consequent development of smart aging offers endless possibilities for improving the quality of life and health of older people, making cities more inclusive of older people. Researchers from developed economies have attempted to address the health issues of older adults through a technology that combines physical exercise and digital technology called Exergame. However, existing projects are not suitable for older adults in emerging economies due to differences in national conditions. The aim of this project is therefore to propose a universal approach to designing a health-promoting Exergame system in the format of a virtual urban community to help emerging economies cope with aging populations, making cities more inclusive. To verify the feasibility of this approach, the authors designed an expandable Exergame called “Fit Islands”, using China as a case study. Based on the initial demonstration, the authors conducted functional tests. The result is that Fit Islands can meet the development objective of motivating Chinese older people to increase their physical activity, providing initial evidence of the feasibility of an Exergame system to promote healthy aging in emerging economies. The application of Fit Islands demonstrates the feasibility of the universal Exergame development method, which can, in principle, provide comprehensive and practical guidance for other countries.

Delay and Energy Efficient Offloading Strategies for an IoT Integrated Water Distribution System in Smart Cities,"In the fast-moving world of information and communications technologies, one significant issue in metropolitan cities is water scarcity and the need for an intelligent water distribution system for sustainable water management. An IoT-based monitoring system can improve water distribution system management and mitigate challenges in the distribution network networks such as leakage, breakage, theft, overflow, dry running of pumps and so on. However, the increase in the number of communication and sensing devices within smart cities has evoked challenges to existing communication networks due to the increase in delay and energy consumption within the network. The work presents different strategies for efficient delay and energy offloading in IoT-integrated water distribution systems in smart cities. Different IoT-enabled communication network topology diagrams are proposed, considering the different water network design parameters, land cover patterns and wireless channels for communication. From these topologies and by considering all the relevant communication parameters, the optimum communication network architecture to continuously monitor a water distribution network in a metropolitan city in India is identified. As a case study, an IoT design and analysis model is studied for a secondary metropolitan city in India. The selected study area is in Kochi, India. Based on the site-specific model and land use and land cover pattern, delay and energy modeling of the IoT-based water distribution system is discussed. Algorithms for node categorisation and edge-to-fog allocation are discussed, and numerical analyses of delay and energy models are included. An approximation of the delay and energy of the network is calculated using these models. On the basis of these study results, and state transition diagrams, the optimum placement of fog nodes linked with edge nodes and a cloud server could be carried out. Also, by considering different scenarios, up to a 40% improvement in energy efficiency can be achieved by incorporating a greater number of states in the state transition diagram. These strategies could be utilized in implementing delay and energy-efficient IoT-enabled communication networks for site-specific applications.

Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to Predict the Influence of Weather on the Thermal Soaring Capabilities of Sailplanes for Smart City Applications,"Background: Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, could potentially be a key part of future smart cities by aiding traffic management, infrastructure inspection and maybe even last mile delivery. This paper contributes to the research on managing a fleet of soaring aircraft by gaining an understanding of the influence of the weather on soaring capabilities. To do so, machine learning algorithms were trained on flight data, which was recorded in the UK over the past ten years at selected gliding clubs (i.e., sailplanes). Methods: A random forest regressor was trained to predict the flight duration and a random forest (RF) classifier was used to predict whether at least one flight on a given day managed to soar in thermals. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a form of explainable artificial intelligence (AI), was used to understand the predictions given by the models. Results: The best RF have a mean absolute error of 5.7 min (flight duration) and an accuracy of 81.2% (probability of soaring in a thermal on a given day). The explanations derived from SHAP are in line with the common knowledge about the effect of weather systems to predict soaring potential. However, the key conclusion of this study is the importance of combining human knowledge with machine learning to devise a holistic explanation of a machine learning model and to avoid misinterpretations.

A Review on Key Innovation Challenges for Smart City Initiatives,"Smart city initiatives are being promoted across the world to address major urban challenges, and they all share a common belief in the transformative power of digital technologies. However, the pace of innovation in smart cities seems to be much slower than the rapid and profoundly disruptive transformations brought about by digital innovation in many other domains. To develop new insights about the main causes behind this relatively modest success, this study provides a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the connection between major smart city challenges and the essential properties of digital innovation. The review involved the qualitative analysis of 44 research papers reporting on smart city innovation practices and outcomes. The results characterize five major challenge categories for smart city innovation: Strategic vision; Organizational Capabilities and Agility; Technology Domestication; Ecosystem Development; and Transboundary Innovation. This study also explores the connections between these challenges and concrete digital innovation practices in smart city initiatives. The main conclusion is that current innovation practices in smart cities are not properly aligned with what the research literature commonly describes as core properties of digital innovation and that this might be a major cause behind the limited progress in smart city initiatives.

Implementation of a Trust-Based Framework for Substation Defense in the Smart Grid,"The Smart Grid is a cyber-integrated power grid that manages electricity generation, transmission, and distribution to consumers and central to its functioning is the substation. However, integrating cyber-infrastructure into the substation has increased its attack surface. Notably, sophisticated attacks such as the PipeDream APT exploit multiple device protocols, such as Modbus, DNP3, and IEC61850. The substation’s constraints pose challenges for implementing security measures such as encryption and intrusion detection systems. To address this, we propose a comprehensive trust-based framework aimed at enhancing substation security. The framework comprises a trust model, a risk posture model, and a trust transferability model. The trust model detects protocol-based attacks on Intelligent Electronic Devices and SCADA HMI systems, while the risk posture model dynamically assesses the substation’s risk posture. The trust transferability model evaluates the feasibility of transferring and integrating a device and its trust capabilities into a different substation.

Intelligent Waste-Volume Management Method in the Smart City Concept,"This research paper proposes an innovative approach to urban waste management using intelligent methods of classification, clustering, and forecasting. The application of this approach allows for more efficient waste management and contributes to the sustainable development of the urban environment. The aim of this research is to develop an intelligent method for urban waste management, which includes clustering of waste sources, accurate forecasting of waste volumes, and evaluation of forecast results. To achieve this goal, a real dataset with city characteristics and waste data was used. On account of the war in Ukraine, the authors faced the problem of obtaining open data on waste in Ukraine, so it was decided to use data from another city (Singapore). The results show the high efficiency of the developed method. Comparison of the obtained results with the results of the nearest similar works shows that the main feature of this study is the high accuracy of waste-volume forecasting using the XGBoost model, which reached a level of up to 98%.

Smart Grid Resilience for Grid-Connected PV and Protection Systems under Cyber Threats,"In recent years, the integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and communication networks has presented significant challenges to power system control and protection, primarily as a result of the emergence of smart grids and cyber threats. As the use of grid-connected solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems continues to increase with the use of intelligent PV inverters, the susceptibility of these systems to cyber attacks and their potential impact on grid stability emerges as a critical concern based on the inverter control models. This study explores the cyber-threat consequences of selectively targeting the components of PV systems, with a special focus on the inverter and Overcurrent Protection Relay (OCR). This research also evaluates the interconnectedness between these two components under different cyber-attack scenarios. A three-phase radial Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) is employed for grid modeling and transient analysis under different cyber attacks. The findings of our analysis highlight the complex relationship between vulnerabilities in inverters and relays, emphasizing the consequential consequences of affecting one of the components on the other. In addition, this work aims to evaluate the impact of cyber attacks on the overall performance and stability of grid-connected PV systems. For example, in the attack on the PV inverters, the OCR failed to identify and eliminate the fault during a pulse signal attack with a short duration of 0.1 s. This resulted in considerable harmonic distortion and substantial power losses as a result of the protection system’s failure to recognize and respond to the irregular attack signal. Our study provides significant contributions to the understanding of cybersecurity in grid-connected solar PV systems. It highlights the importance of implementing improved protective measures and resilience techniques in response to the changing energy environment towards smart grids.

Vision-Based Object Localization and Classification for Electric Vehicle Driving Assistance,"The continuous advances in intelligent systems and cutting-edge technology have greatly influenced the development of intelligent vehicles. Recently, integrating multiple sensors in cars has improved and spread the advanced drive-assistance systems (ADAS) solutions for achieving the goal of total autonomy. Despite current self-driving approaches and systems, autonomous driving is still an open research issue that must guarantee the safety and reliability of drivers. This work employs images from two cameras and Global Positioning System (GPS) data to propose a 3D vision-based object localization and classification method for assisting a car during driving. The experimental platform is a prototype of a two-sitter electric vehicle designed and assembled for navigating the campus under controlled mobility conditions. Simultaneously, color and depth images from the primary camera are combined to extract 2D features, which are reprojected into 3D space. Road detection and depth features isolate point clouds representing the objects to construct the occupancy map of the environment. A convolutional neural network was trained to classify typical urban objects in the color images. Experimental tests validate car and object pose in the occupancy map for different scenarios, reinforcing the car position visually estimated with GPS measurements.

The evolving socio-technical landscape has prompted an increased focus on responsible innovation and technology (RIT) among technology companies, driven by mounting public scrutiny, regulatory pressure, and concerns about reputation and long-term sustainability. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on responsible practices by conducting a policy review that delves into insights from the most influential high-tech companies’—so-called tech giants’—RIT guidance. The findings disclose that (a) leading high-tech companies have started to focus on RIT; (b) the main RIT policy focus of the leading high-tech companies is artificial intelligence; (c) trustworthiness and acceptability of technology are the most common policy areas; (d) affordability related to technology outcomes and adoption is almost absent from the policy; and (e) sustainability considerations are rarely part of the RIT policy, but are included in annual corporate reporting. Additionally, this paper proposes a RIT assessment framework that integrates views from the policy community, academia, and the industry and can be used for evaluating how well high-tech companies adhere to RIT practices. The knowledge assembled in this study is instrumental in advancing RIT practices, ultimately contributing to technology-driven cities and societies that prioritise human and social well-being.

Development of a Microservice-Based Storm Sewer Simulation System with IoT Devices for Early Warning in Urban Areas,"This study proposes an integrated approach to developing a Microservice, Cloud Computing, and Software as a Service (SaaS)-based Real-Time Storm Sewer Simulation System (MBSS). The MBSS combined the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) microservice running on the EC2 Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform and an Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring device to prevent disasters in smart cities. The Python language and Docker container were used to develop the MBSS and Web API of the SWMM microservice. The IoT comprised a pressure water level meter, an Arduino, and a Raspberry Pi. After laboratory channel testing, the simulated and IoT-monitored water levels under different flow rates indicate that the simulated water level in MBSS was such as that monitored by the IoT. These findings suggest that MBSS is feasible and can be further used as a reference for smart urban early warning systems. The MBSS can be applied in on-site stormwater sewers during heavy rain, with the goal of issuing early warnings and reducing disaster damage. The use case can be the process by which the SWMM model parameters will be optimized based on the water level data from IoT monitoring devices in stormwater sewer systems. The predicted rainfall will then be used by the SWMM microservices of MBSS to simulate the water levels at all manholes. The status of the water levels will finally be applied to early warning.

Real-Time Recognition and Localization of Apples for Robotic Picking Based on Structural Light and Deep Learning,"The apple is a delicious fruit with high nutritional value that is widely grown around the world. Apples are traditionally picked by hand, which is very inefficient. The development of advanced fruit-picking robots has great potential to replace manual labor. A major prerequisite for a robot to successfully pick fruits the accurate identification and positioning of the target fruit. The active laser vision systems based on structured algorithms can achieve higher recognition rates by quickly capturing the three-dimensional information of objects. This study proposes to combine the laser active vision system with the YOLOv5 neural network model to recognize and locate apples on trees. The method obtained accurate two-dimensional pixel coordinates, which, when combined with the active laser vision system, can be converted into three-dimensional world coordinates for apple recognition and positioning. On this basis, we built a picking robot platform equipped with this visual recognition system, and carried out a robot picking experiment. The experimental findings showcase the efficacy of the neural network recognition algorithm proposed in this study, which achieves a precision rate of 94%, an average precision mAP% of 92.86%, and a spatial localization accuracy of approximately 4 mm for the visual system. The implementation of this control method in simulated harvesting operations shows the promise of more precise and successful fruit positioning. In summary, the integration of the YOLOv5 neural network model with an active laser vision system presents a novel and effective approach for the accurate identification and positioning of apples. The achieved precision and spatial accuracy indicate the potential for enhanced fruit-harvesting operations, marking a significant step towards the automation of fruit-picking processes.

A Smart City Is a Safe City: Analysis and Evaluation of the State of Crime and Safety in Polish Cities,"The concept of a smart city is based on the extensive multidimensional use of information and communication technologies to create the most favorable living conditions for residents and visitors. It is also important to create favorable conditions for economic activity while respecting the environment. One of the most important dimensions of this concept is security in the broadest sense, particularly that which concerns urban residents. This article addresses this subject by analyzing crime and determining the state of safety in 16 Polish provincial cities between 2013–2022. The measure of this state was chosen to be a set of indicators characterizing a number of registered criminal and economic offenses in the studied cities. On this basis, values of the indices of the dynamics of change for these offenses in individual cities in the analyzed period were determined. In the next stage, the number of offenses was compared to the number of residents of the cities under study and the indices of concentration for total offenses (LQT) and for individual types of offenses (LQn) were determined. Based on these results, the studied cities were divided into four concentration levels. Afterward, these results were used for a multi-criteria analysis of the safety of studied cities, which was carried out using the TOPSIS method. The calculated values of the safety index (Pi) formed the basis for creating a ranking and specifying security levels of studied cities. The results indicate a wide variation among the cities in terms of safety levels. Gdańsk, Bydgoszcz, Olsztyn and Zielona Góra were found to be the safest cities, while Szczecin was found to be the least safe. The methodology developed and the results obtained show the validity of conducting comparative research in areas relevant to the implementation of the smart cities concept. The knowledge gained can be used to build strategies and conduct policies with regard to improving safety in cities, especially those aspiring to be smart cities.

"A Quantitative Model of Innovation Readiness in Urban Mobility: A Comparative Study of Smart Cities in the EU, Eastern Asia, and USA Regions","The smart cities paradigm has gained significant attention as a tool to address the multifaceted challenges posed by contemporary urban mobility systems. While cities are eager to integrate cutting-edge technologies to evolve into digital and intelligent hubs, they often deal with infrastructure and governance bottlenecks that prevent the rapid adoption of industry-driven innovations. This study introduces a three-step methodological approach to forecast a city’s innovation readiness in urban mobility, thus facilitating city-led innovation and identifying key areas within urban mobility systems that require attention. Initially, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken to ascertain the most impactful innovation indicators influencing a city’s ability to embrace new technologies. Subsequently, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to identify these indicators, highlighting the primary markers of innovation for each city. The final step involved the application of both random and fixed-effects regression models to quantify the influence of distinct unobserved variables—such as economic, cultural, and political factors—on the innovation readiness of various cities. The methodology’s effectiveness was tested using data from cities across diverse regions. The findings underscore that merely 7 out of 21 innovation indicators are critical for assessing a city’s innovation readiness. Moreover, the random-effects model was identified as the most suitable for capturing the nuances of unobserved variables in the studied cities. The innovation readiness scores at the city level revealed a diverse range, with cities like Madrid, Gothenburg, and Mechelen demonstrating high readiness, while others like Kalisz and Datong showed lower scores. This research contributes to the strategic planning for smart cities, offering a robust framework for policymakers to enhance innovation readiness and foster sustainable urban development, with a newfound emphasis on city-specific analysis.

Environmental Impact Analysis of Residential Energy Solutions in Latvian Single-Family Houses: A Lifecycle Perspective,"This study aims to compare the technological solutions that can contribute to more sustainable energy use in the residential sector. Specifically, the goal of the study is to evaluate the environmental impact of different energy (heat and electricity) supply technologies applicable for an average size single-family building in Latvia, a country known for climatic condition characterized by cold winters with frequent snowfall. The study applies the lifecycle assessment methodology of ISO 14040 and the impact assessment method known as ReCiPe 2016 v1.1, which has not been used before for the scope addressed in the study in the context of single-family building energy supply technologies for climatic conditions in Latvia. Thus, the results of the study will provide new information for more sustainable energy solutions in this area of study. The technologies included in the defined scenarios are conventional boiler, electricity from the grid, Stirling engine, and solar photovoltaics (PV). The results of the lifecycle impact assessment for damage categories revealed that all scenarios have a high impact on human health due to fine particulate matter formation followed by global warming. Regarding the damage to the ecosystem, the terrestrial ecotoxicity category has highest impact, followed by global warming. Sensitivity analyses affirmed the model’s validity and also showed that the impacts of conventional systems were most sensitive to changes in electricity consumption, and therefore, the scenarios with electricity supply from a Stirling engine or PV can be considered a more robust solution under changing electricity demands from an environmental perspective.

Optimal Dispatch Strategy for Electric Vehicles in V2G Applications,"The overutilization of electric vehicles (EVs) has the potential to result in significant challenges regarding the reliability, contingency, and standby capabilities of traditional power systems. The utilization of renewable energy distributed generator (REDG) presents a potential solution to address these issues. By incorporating REDG, the reliance of EV charging power on conventional energy sources can be diminished, resulting in significant reductions in transmission losses and enhanced capacity within the traditional power system. The effective management of the REDG necessitates intelligent coordination between the available generation capacity of the REDG and the charging and discharging power of EVs. Furthermore, the utilization of EVs as a means of energy storage is facilitated through the integration of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. Despite the importance of the V2G technology for EV owners and electric utility, it still has a slow progress due to the distrust of the revenue model that can encourage the EV owners and the electric utility as well to participate in V2G programs. This study presents a new wear model that aims to precisely assess the wear cost of EV batteries, resulting from their involvement in V2G activities. The proposed model seeks to provide EV owners with a precise understanding of the potential revenue they might obtain from participating in V2G programs, hence encouraging their active engagement in such initiatives. Various EV battery wear models are employed and compared. Additionally, this study introduces a novel method for optimal charging scheduling, which aims to effectively manage the charging and discharging patterns of EVs by utilizing a day-ahead pricing technique. This study presents a novel approach, namely, the gradual reduction of swarm size with the grey wolf optimization (GRSS-GWO) algorithm, for determining the optimal hourly charging/discharging power with short convergence time and the highest accuracy based on maximizing the profit of EV owners.

"Unveiling the Socio-Economic Fragility of a Major Urban Touristic Destination through Open Data and Airbnb Data: The Case Study of Bologna, Italy","In the last decades, tourism in urban areas has been constantly increasing. The need for short-term accommodations has been coupled with the emergence of internet-based services, which makes it easier to match demand (i.e., tourists) and supply (i.e., housing). As a new mass tourist destination, Bologna, Italy, has been experiencing tensions between tourists and long-, mid-, or short-term renters. The possibility of easy profits for lessees has led to an increase in such housing, which can be rented out either for touristic reasons or not. This paper aims to unveil the contribution of short-term rental accommodations in distorting the real estate market and conditioning social and economic inequalities. To do this, multiple linear regression analyses (MLR) were performed between accommodation density, real estate market information, and indicators about social, economic, and demographic vulnerability and fragility. Analyses were based on official open data and datasets from a major web-based hospitality exchange platform, i.e., Airbnb, able to provide information on registered accommodations, e.g., type, characteristics (e.g., number of bedrooms and average rating), and location. Outputs of the analyses reveal the role of Airbnb in both rental market and social, economic, and demographic vulnerability and fragility and, hence, can be a solid tool for public policies, both housing- and tourism-related.

An Urban Acoustic Rainfall Estimation Technique Using a CNN Inversion Approach for Potential Smart City Applications,"The need for robust rainfall estimation has increased with more frequent and intense floods due to human-induced land use and climate change, especially in urban areas. Besides the existing rainfall measurement systems, citizen science can offer unconventional methods to provide complementary rainfall data for enhancing spatial and temporal data coverage. This demand for accurate rainfall data is particularly crucial in the context of smart city innovations, where real-time weather information is essential for effective urban planning, flood management, and environmental sustainability. Therefore, this study provides proof-of-concept for a novel method of estimating rainfall intensity using its recorded audio in an urban area, which can be incorporated into a smart city as part of its real-time weather forecasting system. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) inversion model for acoustic rainfall intensity estimation. The developed CNN rainfall sensing model showed a significant improvement in performance over the traditional approach, which relies on the loudness feature as an input, especially for simulating rainfall intensities above 60 mm/h. Also, a CNN-based denoising framework was developed to attenuate unwanted noises in rainfall recordings, which achieved up to 98% accuracy on the validation and testing datasets. This study and its promising results are a step towards developing an acoustic rainfall sensing tool for citizen-science applications in smart cities. However, further investigation is necessary to upgrade this proof-of-concept for practical applications.

Assessing Factors Influencing Citizens’ Behavioral Intention towards Smart City Living,"The adoption and results achieved by “smart city” projects heavily rely on citizens’ acceptance and behavioral intention to embrace smart city living. Understanding the factors influencing citizens’ behavioral intention towards smart city living is crucial for the effective development and rollout of smart city initiatives. This research paper aims to assess the factors influencing citizens’ behavioral intention towards smart city living using quantitative research methods. Through a comprehensive literature review, an ideation structure was developed, integrating theoretical perspectives from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The structure encompasses key variables such as perceived utility, convenience of use, engagement, trialability, observability, interoperability, willingness, and propensity to embrace smart city lifestyles. A quantitative methodological stance was employed to gather information from a statistically significant subset of citizens residing in urban areas in developed countries. A structured questionnaire, based on the theoretical framework, was formulated and distributed to the participants. Statistical analysis techniques, including structural equation modeling, were used for investigating connections between identified factors and citizens’ behavioral intention towards smart city living. Preliminary findings indicate that behavioral intention towards smart city living strongly depends on attitude and perceived usefulness. By addressing these factors, smart cities can foster greater citizen engagement, participation, and ultimately, the successful realization of smart city living.

PC-ILP: A Fast and Intuitive Method to Place Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in Smart Cities,"The widespread use of electric vehicles necessitates meticulous planning for the placement of charging stations (CSs) in already crowded cities so that they can efficiently meet the charging demand while adhering to various real-world constraints such as the total budget, queuing time, electrical regulations, etc. Many classical and metaheuristic-based approaches provide good solutions, but they are not intuitive, and they do not scale well for large cities and complex constraints. Many classical solution techniques often require prohibitive amounts of memory and their solutions are not easily explainable. We analyzed the layouts of the 50 most populous cities of the world and observed that any city can be represented as a composition of five basic primitive shapes (stretched to different extents). Based on this insight, we use results from classical topology to design a new charging station placement algorithm. The first step is a topological clustering algorithm to partition a large city into small clusters and then use precomputed solutions for each basic shape to arrive at a solution for each cluster. These cluster-level solutions are very intuitive and explainable. Then, the next step is to combine the small solutions to arrive at a full solution to the problem. Here, we use a surrogate function and repair-based technique to fix any resultant constraint violations (after all the solutions are combined). The third step is optional, where we show that the second step can be extended to incorporate complex constraints and secondary objective functions. Along with creating a full software suite, we perform an extensive evaluation of the top 50 cities and demonstrate that our method is not only 30 times faster but its solution quality is also 36.62% better than the gold standard in this area—an integer linear programming (ILP) approach with a practical timeout limit.

Blockchain-Based Malicious Behaviour Management Scheme for Smart Grids,"The smart grid optimises energy transmission efficiency and provides practical solutions for energy saving and life convenience. Along with a decentralised, transparent and fair trading model, the smart grid attracts many users to participate. In recent years, many researchers have contributed to the development of smart grids in terms of network and information security so that the security, reliability and stability of smart grid systems can be guaranteed. However, our investigation reveals various malicious behaviours during smart grid transactions and operations, such as electricity theft, erroneous data injection, and distributed denial of service (DDoS). These malicious behaviours threaten the interests of honest suppliers and consumers. While the existing literature has employed machine learning and other methods to detect and defend against malicious behaviour, these defence mechanisms do not impose any penalties on the attackers. This paper proposes a management scheme that can handle different types of malicious behaviour in the smart grid. The scheme uses a consortium blockchain combined with the best–worst multi-criteria decision method (BWM) to accurately quantify and manage malicious behaviour. Smart contracts are used to implement a penalty mechanism that applies appropriate penalties to different malicious users. Through a detailed description of the proposed algorithm, logic model and data structure, we show the principles and workflow of this scheme for dealing with malicious behaviour. We analysed the system’s security attributes and tested the system’s performance. The results indicate that the system meets the security attributes of confidentiality and integrity. The performance results are similar to the benchmark results, demonstrating the feasibility and stability of the system.

A Comparative Analysis of Multi-Label Deep Learning Classifiers for Real-Time Vehicle Detection to Support Intelligent Transportation Systems,"An Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is a vital component of smart cities due to the growing number of vehicles year after year. In the last decade, vehicle detection, as a primary component of ITS, has attracted scientific attention because by knowing vehicle information (i.e., type, size, numbers, location speed, etc.), the ITS parameters can be acquired. This has led to developing and deploying numerous deep learning algorithms for vehicle detection. Single Shot Detector (SSD), Region Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN), and You Only Look Once (YOLO) are three popular deep structures for object detection, including vehicles. This study evaluated these methodologies on nine fully challenging datasets to see their performance in diverse environments. Generally, YOLO versions had the best performance in detecting and localizing vehicles compared to SSD and RCNN. Between YOLO versions (YOLOv8, v7, v6, and v5), YOLOv7 has shown better detection and classification (car, truck, bus) procedures, while slower response in computation time. The YOLO versions have achieved more than 95% accuracy in detection and 90% in Overall Accuracy (OA) for the classification of vehicles, including cars, trucks and buses. The computation time on the CPU processor was between 150 milliseconds (YOLOv8, v6, and v5) and around 800 milliseconds (YOLOv7).

Smart City Information Systems: Research on Information Published for Citizens and Design of Effective Content in the Czech Republic,"The concept of Smart Cities integrates innovative technologies to improve citizens’ quality of life in towns and cities worldwide. Crisis management is a separate section directly managed by the leadership of municipalities, cities and counties in cooperation between police, fire and municipal police to ensure the safety of residents and safety in public spaces. The purpose of this study is to investigate to which extent publicly available information related to the field of crisis management is unavailable to residents in municipalities, towns and cities through online information systems. The primary aim is to provide suggestions for a general information system structure and content that would highlight and satisfy the need to address the crisis management issue, especially in providing immediate information to the population through an innovative online form. The achievement of this goal is methodologically based on qualitative research analysing and comparing the information published for residents through Smart City information systems in selected towns and municipalities. Document analysis or conceptual design was applied, and evaluation criteria for objective assessment of Smart City information systems were appropriately determined. The comparative analysis based on this set of criteria enabled the development of the proposals of information systems’ content that can be used to keep the information systems for Smart Cities in cities, municipalities and regions, actual and beneficial. From the available resources, two main modules that focused either on citizens or cities were synthesised. Moreover, SWOT analysis or the Smart Regions Rapid Response structure was derived. Acquired results outline generic structures and contents that support the development of the concept of Smart Cities and can be suitably implemented for the development of the modification of information systems containing relevant information for residents, cities and municipalities, focusing on citizen safety.

However, the inherent low inertia of such systems poses intricate control challenges that necessitate innovative solutions. To tackle these issues, this paper presents the development of robust-adaptive controllers tailored specifically for grid-forming (GFM) converters. The proposed adaptive-robust controllers are designed to accommodate the diverse range of scenarios encountered in low-inertia MGs. The proposed approach applies both the robust control techniques and adaptive control strategies, thereby offering an effective means to ensure stable and seamless converter performance under varying operating conditions. The efficacy of the introduced adaptive-robust controllers for GFM converters is validated within a low-inertia MG, which is characterized by substantial penetration of converter-interfaced resources. The validation also encompasses diverse MG operational scenarios and conditions.

Should Smart Cities Introduce a New Form of Public Transport Vehicles?,"This study shows the concept of an innovative road and rail vehicle as a new form of public transport. Our literature review shows that the idea of a “smart city” contains not only new tools but also vehicles or infrastructure. The new vehicle is proposed based on the observed development of urban public transport means and other novel solutions. A slight innovation proposed here could allow the use of typical and operated tram routes for modified buses. A new type of vehicle could use both the existing tram routes and newly constructed sections with no tracks. It is assumed that new vehicles would drive with trams on the same, shared tracks. All of the conditions should reduce the costs of developing public transport networks in many cities where tram networks already exist. This paper contains a description of the idea and a potential case study location. The implementation conditions are outlined in the Discussion section. The title’s question is also considered there: “Should smart cities introduce a new form of public transport vehicles?” In addition, the potential benefits as well as threats are presented. Conclusions define the next steps for the research. So, this paper is an introduction to the wider research. It will popularize the idea of a new vehicle and could motivate the industry to construct a prototype. At this stage, no models or detailed calculations were conducted.

Adaptive Smart eHealth Framework for Personalized Asthma Attack Prediction and Safe Route Recommendation,"Recently, there has been growing interest in using smart eHealth systems to manage asthma. However, limitations still exist in providing smart services and accurate predictions tailored to individual patients’ needs. This study aims to develop an adaptive ubiquitous computing framework that leverages different bio-signals and spatial data to provide personalized asthma attack prediction and safe route recommendations. We proposed a smart eHealth framework consisting of multiple layers that employ telemonitoring application, environmental sensors, and advanced machine-learning algorithms to deliver smart services to the user. The proposed smart eHealth system predicts asthma attacks and uses spatial data to provide a safe route that drives the patient away from any asthma trigger. Additionally, the framework incorporates an adaptation layer that continuously updates the system based on real-time environmental data and daily bio-signals reported by the user. The developed telemonitoring application collected a dataset containing 665 records used to train the prediction models. The testing result demonstrates a remarkable 98% accuracy in predicting asthma attacks with a recall of 96%. The eHealth system was tested online by ten asthma patients, and its accuracy achieved 94% of accuracy and a recall of 95.2% in generating safe routes for asthma patients, ensuring a safer and asthma-trigger-free experience. The test shows that 89% of patients were satisfied with the safer recommended route than their usual one. This research contributes to enhancing the capabilities of smart healthcare systems in managing asthma and improving patient outcomes. The adaptive feature of the proposed eHealth system ensures that the predictions and recommendations remain relevant and personalized to the current conditions and needs of the individual.

Ranking Sustainable Smart City Indicators Using Combined Content Analysis and Analytic Hierarchy Process Techniques,"Sustainable Smart Cities have a significant potential to ensure equal access to public services, achieve sustainability and governance transparency, improve livability, and anticipate and mitigate increasingly changing threats. This study aims at prioritizing a core set of Sustainable Smart City (SSC) indicators using a combined methodology: (a) Content Analysis and (b) Analytic Hierarchy Process. The study’s contribution is that it successfully developed a more robust ranking of the above-mentioned set of indicators by combining AHP and co-occurrence analyses. The final combined ranking is intended to serve as a Decision Support Tool to streamline the decision-making process and help decision-makers prioritize dimensions to measure, achieve, or monitor actions when they cannot be undertaken simultaneously in contexts of economic recessions, financial constraints, and resource mobilization challenges. The findings draw attention to the need for considering the concept of SSCs through the prism of interconnecting the various current technology-driven “smart silos” under an inclusive umbrella that focuses on the combinations and connectedness to achieve a systemic approach to sustainability and smartness that none of those single areas can achieve in isolation. The results also revealed an interesting paradox, which relegated the Technology and ICT dimension to the bottom of the ranking, contrary to the widespread consensus and opinion, opening an opportunity for discussion among peers.

Optimal Water Management Strategies: Paving the Way for Sustainability in Smart Cities,"Global urbanization and increasing water demand make efficient water resource management crucial. This study employs Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to evaluate smart city water management strategies. We use representative criteria, employ objective judgment, assign weights through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and score strategies based on meeting these criteria. We find that the “Effectiveness and Risk Management” criterion carries the highest weight (15.28%), underscoring its pivotal role in strategy evaluation and robustness. Medium-weight criteria include “Resource Efficiency, Equity, and Social Considerations” (10.44%), “Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of Implementation” (10.10%), and “Environmental Impact” (9.84%) for ecological mitigation. “Community Engagement and Public Acceptance” (9.79%) recognizes involvement, while “Scalability and Adaptability” (9.35%) addresses changing conditions. “Return on Investment” (9.07%) and “Regulatory and Policy Alignment” (8.8%) balance financial and governance concerns. Two low-weight criteria, “Data Reliability” (8.78%) and “Long-Term Sustainability” (8.55%), stress data accuracy and sustainability. Highly weighted strategies like “Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, Behavior Change” and “Smart Irrigation Systems” are particularly effective in improving water management in smart cities. However, medium-weighted (e.g., “Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness”, “Policy and Regulation”, “Rainwater Harvesting”, “Offshore Floating Photovoltaic Systems”, “Collaboration and Partnerships”, “Graywater Recycling and Reuse”, and “Distributed Water Infrastructure”) and low-weighted (e.g., “Water Desalination”) strategies also contribute and can be combined with higher-ranked ones to create customized water management approaches for each smart city’s unique context. This research is significant because it addresses urban water resource management complexity, offers a multi-criteria approach to enhance traditional single-focused methods, evaluates water strategies in smart cities comprehensively, and provides a criteria-weight-based resource allocation framework for sustainable decisions, boosting smart city resilience. Note that results may vary based on specific smart city needs and constraints. Future studies could explore factors like climate change on water management in smart cities and consider alternative MCDM methods like TOPSIS or ELECTRE for strategy evaluation.

Train to Vehicle: Toward Sustainable Transportation in Dense Urban Regions,"This article investigates the feasibility of using regenerative energy from braking trains to charge electric buses in the context of New York City’s (NYC) subway and electric bus networks. A case study centered around NYC’s system has been performed to evaluate the benefits and challenges pertaining to the use of the preexisting subway network as a power supply for its new all-electric buses. The analysis shows that charging electric buses via the subway system during subway off-peak periods does not hinder regular train operation. In addition, having the charging electric buses connected to the third rail allows for more regenerative braking energy (RBE) to be recuperated, decreasing the energy wasted throughout the system. It was also found that including a wayside energy storage system (WESS) reduces the overall substation peak power consumption.

Multiple Linear Regression and Machine Learning for Predicting the Drinking Water Quality Index in Al-Seine Lake,"Ensuring safe and clean drinking water for communities is crucial, and necessitates effective tools to monitor and predict water quality due to challenges from population growth, industrial activities, and environmental pollution. This paper evaluates the performance of multiple linear regression (MLR) and nineteen machine learning (ML) models, including algorithms based on regression, decision tree, and boosting. Models include linear regression (LR), least angle regression (LAR), Bayesian ridge chain (BR), ridge regression (Ridge), k-nearest neighbor regression (K-NN), extra tree regression (ET), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The research’s objective is to estimate the surface water quality of Al-Seine Lake in Lattakia governorate using the MLR and ML models. We used water quality data from the drinking water lake of Lattakia City, Syria, during years 2021–2022 to determine the water quality index (WQI). The predictive performance of both the MLR and ML models was evaluated using statistical methods such as the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) to estimate their efficiency. The results indicated that the MLR model and three of the ML models, namely linear regression (LR), least angle regression (LAR), and Bayesian ridge chain (BR), performed well in predicting the WQI. The MLR model had an R2 of 0.999 and an RMSE of 0.149, while the three ML models had an R2 of 1.0 and an RMSE of approximately 0.0. These results support using both MLR and ML models for predicting the WQI with very high accuracy, which will contribute to improving water quality management.

The Exclusiveness of Smart Cities—Myth or Reality? Comparative Analysis of Selected Economic and Demographic Conditions of Polish Cities,"The Smart City concept is perceived as a method of dynamic development of cities and an opportunity to improve the quality of life of the urban community. Nevertheless, it is not without its disadvantages, among which the possibility of exclusion (economic, social or digital) is most often mentioned. However, the literature on the subject lacks empirical research verifying this allegation. For this reason, the purpose of this article is to conduct a comparative analysis of economic and social conditions in 17 Polish cities, 3 of which are recognized as Smart Cities in international rankings. By analyzing the economic and demographic conditions in the long term, an attempt is made to answer the question of whether Smart Cities offer better living conditions, and if so, how big is the imbalance and the risk of excluding other cities? In the course of the research, the following are taken into account: tax revenue per capita, unemployment rate, population density and level, as well as the share of working and post-working age population. These parameters are analyzed using descriptive statistics and systematized using multi-criteria analysis. The collective comparison of all the surveyed provincial cities shows that the best economic and demographic conditions apply to cities recognized as smart. The average annual rate of changes in tax revenues in the surveyed cities ranges from 5% to almost 8% and is the highest in Warsaw, Kraków and Wrocław. These cities are also characterized by the lowest unemployment rate, ranging from 3% to 4% (in other cities, from 4% to almost 7%). The mentioned cities and Gdańsk are the only ones with a positive rate of population change (from 0.62% to 1.08%). Other studied cities are systematically depopulating (annual rate of change from −0.37% to −7.09%). In Warsaw, Wrocław and Kraków, the share of the working-age population is also decreasing the slowest (the annual rate of change below −1.0%). The cities recognized as smart (Warsaw, Kraków and Wrocław) are matched by Gdańsk and Poznań, which can be considered strong contenders for being smart. Unfortunately, the remaining cities are far from the leaders of the ranking, which may expose them to economic and social exclusion, all the more so that the parameters examined in them are characterized by negative tendencies. It can, therefore, be concluded that striving to be smart can be a cause of increasing the economic and demographic distance. Therefore, it may increase unbalance and generate exclusion in the analyzed areas.

The Implications of a Co-Created Software Solution for Mobility in Rural Areas,"This paper explores the challenges in providing digital services of general interest in rural areas and proposes co-created ride-sharing software solutions to address the specific needs of these regions. This applied research is part of the Smarte.Land.Regionen project, which aims to improve digital public services at the district level. Focusing on rural mobility, the paper introduces ride-sharing benches enhanced with software as a possible low-threshold solution. Via workshops, surveys, and market research, the study identifies barriers to the adoption of ride-sharing benches and investigates factors contributing to their success. The software will be developed in an agile process together with partner counties and applied in a real-world case study. The proposed software solution emphasizes user-centered development, the geographical location of benches, and the prioritization of ride requests over ride offers. The findings highlight safety concerns, a lack of reliability, and the importance of obtaining people who are theoretically interested in solutions to actively participate in them. The paper emphasizes the importance of collaborative development with county stakeholders while also acknowledging the inherent limitations as the overall process becomes more complex and organizational obstacles arise. In addition, the findings suggest that the current state of rural mobility cannot be fundamentally changed by the implementation of ride-sharing software alone. Future research should focus on sustaining and scaling digital solutions, measuring their impact on rural mobility, and ensuring their transferability to other regions. The goal is to contribute to inclusive and sustainable rural development by improving access to digital public services and promoting the adoption of tailored mobility solutions.

Investigation of Data Quality Assurance across IoT Protocol Stack for V2I Interactions,"Networking protocols have undergone significant developments and adaptations to cater for unique communication needs within the IoT paradigm. However, meeting these requirements in the context of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications becomes a multidimensional problem due to factors like high mobility, intermittent connectivity, rapidly changing topologies, and an increased number of nodes. Thus, examining these protocols based on their characteristics and comparative analyses from the literature has shown that there is still room for improvement, particularly in ensuring efficiency in V2I interactions. This study aims to investigate the most viable network protocols for V2I communications, focusing on ensuring data quality (DQ) across the first three layers of the IoT protocol stack. This presents an improved understanding of the performance of network protocols in V2I communication. The findings of this paper showed that although each protocol offers unique strengths when evaluated against the identified dimensions of DQ, a cross-layer protocol fusion may be necessary to meet specific DQ dimensions. With the complexities and specific demands of V2I communications, it’s clear that no single protocol from our tri-layered perspective can solely fulfil all IP-based communication requirements given that the V2I communication landscape is teeming with heterogeneity, where a mixture of protocols is required to address unique communication demands.

A Review of Parking Slot Types and their Detection Techniques for Smart Cities,"Smart parking system plays a critical role in the overall development of the cities. The capability to precisely detect an open parking space nearby is necessary for autonomous vehicle parking for smart cities. Finding parking spaces is a big issue in big cities. Many of the existing parking guidance systems use fixed IoT sensors or cameras that are unable to offer information from the perspective of the driver. Accurately locating parking spaces can be difficult since they come in a range of sizes and colors that are blocked by objects that seem different depending on the environmental lighting. There are numerous auto industry players engaged in the advanced testing of driverless cars. A vacant parking space must be found, and the car must be directed to park there in order for the operation to succeed. The machine learning-based algorithms created to locate parking spaces and techniques and methods utilizing dashcams and fish-eye cameras are reviewed in this study. In response to the increase in dashcams, neural network-based techniques are created for identifying open parking spaces in dashcam videos. The paper proposed the review of the existing parking slot types and their detection techniques. The review will highlight the importance and scope of a smart parking system for smart cities.

"Impact of Large-Scale Electric Vehicles’ Promotion in Thailand Considering Energy Mix, Peak Load, and Greenhouse Gas Emissions","Thailand’s policies are in accord with the global drive to electrify transportation vehicle fleets due to climate concerns. This dedication is evident through its adoption of the 30@30 initiative and the planned ban on new internal combustion (IC) engine vehicles by 2035, showcasing a strong commitment. The objective of this study was to utilize the Low Emission Analysis Platform (LEAP) software to model the transition possibilities for electric vehicle (EV). Emphasis was placed on the future of the light-duty vehicle (LDV) sector, encompassing the energy sources, electric power demands, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Two scenarios were evaluated: one involving rapid economic growth and the other characterized by a more-gradual expansion. The former projection foresees 382 vehicles per thousand people by 2040, while the latter estimate envisions 338 vehicles. In the scenario of high growth, the vehicle stock could surge by 70% (27-million), whereas in the case of low growth, it might experience a 47% rise (23.3-million) compared to the base year (15.8 million). The increased adoption of EVs will lead to a decrease in energy demand owing to improved fuel efficiency. Nonetheless, even in the most-extreme EV scenarios, the proportion of electricity in the energy mix will remain below one-third. While GHG emissions will decrease, there is potential for even greater emission control through the enforcement of stricter emission standards. Significant EV adoption could potentially stress power grids, and the demand for charging might give rise to related challenges. The deployment of public fast charging infrastructure could provide a solution by evenly distributing the load across the day. In the most-rapid EV penetration scenario, a public charging program could cap the demand at 9300 MW, contrasting with the 21,000 MW demand for home charging. Therefore, a recommended approach involves devising an optimal strategy that considers EV adoption, a tariff structure with incentives, and the preparedness of the infrastructure.

Enhancing Energy Efficiency in Connected Vehicles for Traffic Flow Optimization,"In urban settings, the prevalence of traffic lights often leads to fluctuations in traffic patterns and increased energy utilization among vehicles. Recognizing this challenge, this research addresses the adverse effects of traffic lights on the energy efficiency of electric vehicles (EVs) through the introduction of a Multi-Intersections-Based Eco-Approach and Departure strategy (M-EAD). This innovative strategy is designed to enhance various aspects of urban mobility, including vehicle energy efficiency, traffic flow optimization, and battery longevity, all while ensuring a satisfactory driving experience. The M-EAD strategy unfolds in two distinct stages: First, it optimizes eco-friendly green signal windows at traffic lights, with a primary focus on minimizing travel delays by solving the shortest path problem. Subsequently, it employs a receding horizon framework and leverages an iterative dynamic programming algorithm to refine speed trajectories. The overarching objective is to curtail energy consumption and reduce battery wear by identifying the optimal speed trajectory for EVs in urban environments. Furthermore, the research substantiates the real-world efficacy of this approach through on-road vehicle tests, attesting to its viability and practicality in actual road scenarios. In the proposed case, the simulation results showcase notable achievements, with energy consumption reduced by 0.92% and battery wear minimized to a mere 0.0017%. This research, driven by the pressing issue of urban traffic energy efficiency, not only presents a solution in the form of the M-EAD strategy but also contributes to the fields of sustainable urban mobility and EV performance optimization. By tackling the challenges posed by traffic lights, this work offers valuable insights and practical implications for improving the sustainability and efficiency of urban transportation systems.

The Use of the Smart Technology for Creating an Inclusive Urban Public Space,"This paper strives to enhance the inclusivity of urban public spaces, which play a crucial role in providing essential services for all citizens, including community building, physical and mental well-being, social interaction, civic engagement, citizen participation, and economic vitality. Despite the importance of these spaces, as recognized by the UN’s 2030 sustainability goals, the 2023 UN sustainable development report and scholars have drawn attention to their low availability, particularly for low-income individuals, women, children, and people with disabilities. To improve the inclusivity of public spaces, this paper offers the following contributions. (i) The establishment of a comprehensive framework for assessing public space inclusivity. This framework incorporates eight indicators: spatial distribution, typology, facilities and services, green and humid areas, governance and management, safety, user categories, and user satisfaction. (ii) The utilization of the framework to assess the inclusivity of public spaces in Nablus, a major Palestinian city. This assessment confirms the observations made by the UN and scholars regarding the low inclusivity of public spaces; in particular, a lack of public space, poor spatial distribution, and user dissatisfaction with safety conditions and services. (iii) The introduction of the concept of smart public space, which involves citizens in the governance of this space and leverages smart technology for monitoring, providing real-time information and services to citizens, improving facility efficiency, and creating an eco-friendly environment that preserves resources and biodiversity. By addressing these aspects, this paper enhances inclusivity.

Should Autonomous Vehicles Collaborate in a Complex Urban Environment or Not?,"A specialized version of collaborative driving is convoy driving. It is referred to as the practice of driving more than one vehicle consecutively in the same lane with a small inter-vehicle distance, maintaining the same speed. Extensive research has been conducted on convoys of heavy-duty trucks on the highway; however, limited research has studied convoy driving in an urban environment. The complex dynamics of an urban environment require short-lived collaboration with varying numbers of vehicles rather than collaborating over hours. The motivation of this research is to investigate how convoy driving can be realized to address the challenges of an urban environment and achieve the benefits of autonomous driving such as reduced fuel consumption, travel time, improved safety, and ride comfort. In this work, the best-fitted coalitional game framework is utilized to formulate the convoy driving problem as a coalition formation game in an urban environment. A hypothesis is formulated that traveling in a coalition is more beneficial for a vehicle than traveling alone. In connection with this, a coalitional game and an all-comprehensive utility function are designed, modeled, and implemented to facilitate the formation of autonomous vehicle coalitions for convoy driving. Multiple solution concepts, such as the Shapley allocation, the Nucleolus, and the Core, are implemented to solve and analyze the proposed convoy driving game. Furthermore, several coalition formation strategies such as traveling mode selection, selecting optimal coalitions, and making decisions about coalition merging are developed to analyze the behavior of the vehicles. In addition to this, extensive numerical experiments with different settings are conducted to evaluate and validate the performance of the proposed study. The experimental results proved the hypothesis that traveling in a convoy is significantly more beneficial than traveling alone. We conclude that traveling in a convoy is beneficial for coalition sizes of two to four vehicles with an inter-vehicle spacing of less than 4 m considering the limitations of an urban environment. Traveling in a coalition allows vehicles to save on fuel, minimize travel time and enhance safety and comfort. Furthermore, the findings of this research state that achieving the enormous benefits of traveling in a coalition requires finding the right balance between inter-vehicle distance and coalition size. In the future, we plan to extend this work by studying the evolving dynamics of the coalitions and the environment.

Performance Evaluation of Emerging Perovskite Photovoltaic Energy-Harvesting System for BIPV Applications,"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are emerging photovoltaics (PVs) with promising optoelectronic characteristics. PSCs can be semitransparent (ST), which is beneficial in many innovative applications, including building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs). While PSCs exhibit excellent performance potential, enhancements in their stability and scalable manufacturing are required before they can be widely deployed. This work evaluates the real-world effectiveness of using PSCs in BIPVs to accelerate the development progress toward practical implementation. Given the present constraints on PSC module size and efficiency, bus stop shelters are selected for investigation in this work, as they provide a suitably scaled application representing a realistic near-term test case for early-stage research and engineering. An energy-harvesting system for a bus stop shelter in Astana, Kazakhstan, demonstrates the potential performance evaluation platform that can be used for perovskite solar cell modules (PSCMs) in BIPVs. The system includes maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and charge controllers, which can supply PSCM energy to the electronic load. Based on our design, the bus stop shelter has non-transparent and ST PSCMs on the roof and sides, respectively. May (best-case) and December (worst-case) scenarios are considered. According to the results, the PSCMs-equipped bus stop shelter can generate sufficient daily energy for load even in a worst-case scenario.

Energy Saving Optimization of Commercial Complex Atrium Roof with Resilient Ventilation Using Machine Learning,"Carbon-neutral architectural design focuses on rationally utilizing the building’s surroundings to reduce its environmental impact. Resilient ventilation systems, developed according to the thermal comfort requirements of building energy-saving research, have few applications. We studied the Jin-an Shopping Mall in Harbin and established the middle point height (h), middle point horizontal location (d), roof angle (α), and exposure to floor ratio (k) as the morphological parameters of the atrium. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the mean radiant temperature (MRT), and the universal thermal climate index calculations (UTCI), this program was set to switch off air conditioning when the resilient ventilation met the thermal comfort requirement to achieve energy savings. The energy-saving efficiency (U) was calculated based on the energy consumption of the original model, and U could reach 7.34–9.64% according to the simulation and prediction. This study provides methods and a theoretical basis for renovating other commercial complexes to improve comfort and control energy consumption.

Optimising Urban Freight Logistics Using Discrete-Event Simulation and Cluster Analysis: A Stochastic Two-Tier Hub-and-Spoke Architecture Approach,"The transport of freight involves numerous intermediate steps, such as freight consolidation, truck allocation, and routing, all of which exhibit high day-to-day variability. On the delivery side, drivers usually cover specific geographic regions, also known as clusters, to optimise operational efficiency. A crucial aspect of this process is the effective allocation of resources to match business requirements. The discrete-event simulation (DES) technique excels in replicating intricate real-world operations and can integrate a multitude of stochastic variables, thereby enhancing its utility for decision making. The objective of this study is to formulate a routing architecture that integrates with a DES model to capture the variability in freight operations. This integration is intended to provide robust support for informed decision-making processes. A two-tier hub-and-spoke (H&S) architecture was proposed to simulate stochastic routing for the truck fleet, which provided insights into travel distance and time for cluster-based delivery. Real industry data were employed in geographic information systems (GISs) to apply the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering method to identify customer clusters and establish a truck plan based on freight demand and truck capacity. This clustering analysis and simulation approach can serve as a planning tool for freight logistics companies and distributors to optimise their resource utilisation and operational efficiency, and the findings may be applied to develop plans for new regions with customer locations and freight demands. The original contribution of this study is the integration of variable last-mile routing and an operations model for freight decision making.

"Understanding the Spatiotemporal Impacts of the Built Environment on Different Types of Metro Ridership: A Case Study in Wuhan, China","As the backbone of passenger transportation in many large cities around the world, it is particularly important to explore the association between the built environment and metro ridership to promote the construction of smart cities. Although a large number of studies have explored the association between the built environment and metro ridership, they have rarely considered the spatial and temporal heterogeneity between metro ridership and the built environment. Based on metro smartcard data, this study used EM clustering to classify metro stations into five clusters based on the spatiotemporal travel characteristics of the ridership at metro stations. And the GBDT model in machine learning was used to explore the nonlinear association between the built environment and the ridership of different types of stations during four periods in a day (morning peak, noon, evening peak, and night). The results confirm the obvious spatial heterogeneity of the built environment’s impact on the ridership of different types of stations, as well as the obvious temporal heterogeneity of the impact on stations of the same type. In addition, almost all built environment factors have complex nonlinear effects on metro ridership and exhibit obvious threshold effects. It is worth noting that these findings will help the correct decisions be made in constructing land use measures that are compatible with metro functions in smart cities.

Cumulatively Anticipative Car-Following Model with Enhanced Safety for Autonomous Vehicles in Mixed Driver Environments,"The contribution of autonomous vehicles to traffic is one of the key aspects of future ground transportation in smart cities. Autonomous vehicles are able to provide many benefits, but some benefits can only provide advantages if these vehicles comprise a large percent of on the road/driven vehicles, which may take decades. Until then, the robotic drivers in autonomous vehicles will share the same road system with human divers in a mixed-driver environment where the majority of road accidents for autonomous vehicles are associated with the operational inconsistency of human drivers. In this paper, a cumulatively anticipative car-following model (which considers cumulative influences from multiple preceding vehicles) is developed to potentially improve the safety of autonomous vehicles in mixed-driver environments that benefit from enhanced communication between the autonomous vehicles and other components in the transportation system. Through intensive simulations (200 simulations), this study comprehensively evaluates four models including the cumulative anticipative car-following model, the Wiedemann 99 model, adaptive cruise control, and the cooperative adaptive cruise control model. Across 10 scenarios and five speed limits (24.59–33.53 m/s), the cumulative anticipative car-following model consistently demonstrates superior conflict reduction, with average, maximum, and minimum conflict percentages ranging from 77.69% to 91.97% against the Wiedemann 99 model, 67.00% to 93.94% against the adaptive cruise control model, and 69.17% to 93.25% against the cooperative adaptive cruise control model. Notably, the cooperative adaptive cruise control model exhibits suboptimal performance, especially in mixed-driver settings. The cumulative anticipative car-following model also enhances vehicle mobility, reducing average stops by up to 93.54%, 91.74%, 92.04%, 88.60%, and 91.35% in comparison to the other three models at speeds of 24.59 m/s, 26.82 m/s, 29.06 m/s, 31.29 m/s, and 33.53 m/s. Overall, the cumulative anticipative car-following model holds significant potential for conflict reduction and traffic enhancement.

Visual Intelligence in Smart Cities: A Lightweight Deep Learning Model for Fire Detection in an IoT Environment,"The recognition of fire at its early stages and stopping it from causing socioeconomic and environmental disasters remains a demanding task. Despite the availability of convincing networks, there is a need to develop a lightweight network for resource-constraint devices rather than real-time fire detection in smart city contexts. To overcome this shortcoming, we presented a novel efficient lightweight network called FlameNet for fire detection in a smart city environment. Our proposed network works via two main steps: first, it detects the fire using the FlameNet; then, an alert is initiated and directed to the fire, medical, and rescue departments. Furthermore, we incorporate the MSA module to efficiently prioritize and enhance relevant fire-related prominent features for effective fire detection. The newly developed Ignited-Flames dataset is utilized to undertake a thorough analysis of several convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Additionally, the proposed FlameNet achieves 99.40% accuracy for fire detection. The empirical findings and analysis of multiple factors such as model accuracy, size, and processing time prove that the suggested model is suitable for fire detection.

Converged Security and Information Management System as a Tool for Smart City Infrastructure Resilience Assessment,"Current research on smart cities is primarily focused on the area of applicability of information and communication technologies. However, in the context of a multidisciplinary approach, it is also necessary to pay attention to the resilience and converged security of individual infrastructures. Converged security represents a particular security type based on a selected spectrum of certain convergent security types of, assuming the creation of a complementary whole. Considering the outputs of the analysis of security breaches manifestations, this kind of security makes it possible to detect emerging security breaches earlier (still in the symptom stage), thus providing a more efficient and targeted solution suitable for building smart city infrastructure. In its essence, the article refers to the practical application of the converged security theoretical principles presented in the publication to a functional sample, deployed and tested in practical conditions in context of selected smart city infrastructure protection and resilience. Considering the nature of the practical application, the convergence of a wider spectrum of smart security alarm systems in the resilience assessment context is defined. In the beginning, the general principles of security/safety and the need for their convergence are presented. In this context, the mathematical model called Converged Resilience Assessment (CRA) method is presented for better understanding. Subsequently, Physical Security Information Management (PSIM) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are described as a technological concept that can be used for resilience assessment.

IoT Orchestration-Based Optimal Energy Cost Decision Mechanism with ESS Power Optimization for Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading in Nanogrid,"The Internet of things has revolutionized various domains, such as healthcare and navigation systems, by introducing mission-critical capabilities. However, the untapped potential of IoT in the energy sector is a topic of contention. Shifting from traditional mission-critical electric smart grid systems to IoT-based orchestrated frameworks has become crucial to improve performance by leveraging IoT task orchestration technology. Energy trading cost and ESS power optimization have long been concerns in the scientific community. To address these issues, our proposed architecture consists of two primary modules: (1) a nanogrid energy trading cost and ESS power optimization strategy that utilizes particle swarm optimization (PSO), with two objective functions, and (2) an IoT-enabled task orchestration system designed for improved peer-to-peer nanogrid energy trading, incorporating virtual control through orchestration technology. We employ IoT sensors and Raspberry Pi-based Edge technology to virtually operate the entire nanogrid energy trading architecture, encompassing the aforementioned modules. IoT task orchestration automates the interaction between components for service execution, involving five main steps: task generation, device virtualization, task mapping, task scheduling, and task allocation and deployment. Evaluating the proposed model using a real dataset from nanogrid houses demonstrates the significant role of optimization in minimizing energy trading cost and optimizing ESS power utilization. Furthermore, the IoT orchestration results highlight the potential for virtual operation in significantly enhancing system performance.

Availability and Adequacy of Facilities in 15 Minute Community Life Circle Located in Old and New Communities,"The 15 minute Community Life Circle (15 min-CLC) concept is an urban planning approach that aims to provide various daily services for citizens within a short distance. It has been widely adopted in China, especially in large cities. However, there is a lack of research on how to apply the 15 min-CLC concept in second-tier cities, which have high population densities and lower quality of life. This study chose Jinan City as a case study to explore the underdeveloped areas and facilities of 15 min-CLCs in rapidly developing and medium-size cities, called second-tier cities. First, it analyzed the distribution of facilities and residential POIs in old communities, new communities, and the whole city, to find out which types of facilities are missing at the community level. Second, it examined the relationship between facilities and population in each 15 min-CLC by using the Facility to Population Ratio (FPR), to evaluate the sufficiency of facilities to meet the daily needs of residents. Through the analysis of facility distribution and Facility to Population Ratio, our study found that old communities have all the required facility types within each 15 min-CLC, but they do not have enough number of facilities to support the population. At the same time, identified the underdeveloped regions and provided specific development directions for each 15 min-CLC. The FPR methodology developed in this study can be used to evaluate whether the existing facilities can meet the daily needs of residents in a certain region.

Development of a Maturity Model for Assessing Smart Cities: A Focus Area Maturity Model,"The concept of smart cities has gained significant attention due to the potential of smart cities to optimize city services and enhance citizens’ quality of life. Cities are investing in digital transformation to become smarter, sustainable, and resilient. Therefore, there is a need to build a comprehensive and holistic model to assess smart city initiatives. This paper aims to develop a model that can capture the maturity of smart city adoption across various functional domains. These domains are divided into focus areas that capture different dimensions of a smart city and grouped into seven groups: ICT, economy, environment, social, resources, services, and governance. Each focus area has a set of maturity levels that describe the capabilities and outcomes of the city at different stages of development. To develop the model, the focus areas were extracted from the literature based on 16 models that have been reviewed. Assessing these models helped in identifying gaps and building the foundation of the model. Using the information extracted from the literature, a focus area model was designed and developed. The model development included seven main phases, which were: scope, design, populate, test, deploy, and maintain. The current paper validates the proposed model using the Delphi method, which involves the participation of a panel of sixty field experts. The experts evaluated the model’s correctness and completeness based on their experience and provided feedback. This feedback was used to revise and finalize the model. The smart city maturity model provides a framework for benchmarking, planning, and improving smart city initiatives. Cities can use the model to measure their performance and evaluate their weaknesses and strengths. The model is also the most comprehensive in terms of the scope of the focus areas included, and the results show that the model has a high level of accuracy and consistency and can effectively assess smart city adoption.

Profiling Citizens in the Smart City: A Quantitative Study in Wallonia,"Based on the assumption that citizens can participate in smart city development, this paper aims to capture the diversity of their profiles and their positioning towards smart city dynamics. The article starts with a literature review of some models of citizens to better understand how they could be portrayed in the smart city era. Considering that there is no “general citizen” and that usual typologies remain restrictive, we construct tailor-made personas, i.e., fictitious profiles based on real data. To this end, we present the results of a large-scale survey distributed to highly educated Walloon people in the framework of a general public exhibition. The profiling focuses on three aspects: (1) perception of smart city dimensions, (2) intended behavior regarding smart city solutions, and (3) favorite participatory methods. The collected answers were first analyzed with descriptive and nonparametric statistics, then classified with a k-means cluster analysis. The main results are five personas, which highlight the coexistence of different citizen groups that think and behave in a specific way. This process of profiling citizens’ priorities, behaviors, and participatory preferences can help professional designers and local governments to consider various citizens’ perspectives in the design of future smart solutions and participatory processes.

Knowledge Management for Smart Cities—Standardization and Replication as Policy Instruments to Foster the Implementation of Smart City Solutions,"As cities tackle a variety of recent challenges, such as climate change or resilience against natural hazards, the concept of smart cities has increasingly moved into the spotlight to provide technological solutions as appropriate countermeasures. European policymakers chose the systematic funding of smart city initiatives to incentivize and accelerate innovation and sustainability transitions by disseminating knowledge, data, and information. As this undertaking is complex, there is a pressing need to involve and engage capable stakeholders to successfully implement and operate smart city projects. To ensure the diffusion and effectiveness of these initiatives, activities towards replication and standardization as knowledge management instruments have been applied in some of these research projects. However, there is a knowledge gap on how standardization can be combined with replication efforts. As one possible answer, the lighthouse project Smarter Together has actively integrated standardization in its replication activities, resulting in the development of the CEN Workshop Agreement 17381 for describing and assessing smart city solutions. The analysis of these activities resulted in the development of 11 assumptions, which show the role of standardization as a knowledge carrier for replication activities and as a facilitator for stakeholder engagement. These findings reinforce the chosen and future policy decisions.

Pseudolites to Support Location Services in Smart Cities: Review and Prospects,"The location service is an important part of the smart city. A unified location service for outdoor and indoor/overground and underground activity will assist the construction of smart cities. However, with different coordinate systems and data formats, it is difficult to unify various positioning technologies on the same basis. Global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based positioning is the only way to provide absolute location under the Earth-centered, Earth-fixed coordinate system (ECEF). Increasing indoor and underground human activity places significant demand on location-based services but no GNSS signals are available there. Fortunately, a type of satellite that is indoors, known as pseudolite, can transmit GNSS-like ranging signals. Users can obtain their position by receiving ranging signals and their resection without adding or switching other sensors when they go from outdoors to indoors. To complete the outreach of the GNSS indoors and underground to support the smart city, how to adapt the pseudolite design and unify coordinate frames for linking to the GNSS remain to be determined. In this regard, we provide an overview of the history of the research and application of pseudolites, the research progress from both the system side and the user side, and the plans for pseudolite-based location services in smart cities.

Examining the Adoption of Sustainable eMobility-Sharing in Smart Communities: Diffusion of Innovation Theory Perspective,"The transport sector is undergoing disruption due to trends such as tightening environmental targets, digitalization, and servitization, contributing to low-carbon mobility and offering citizen-oriented services. As a response, various initiatives, such as electric mobility (eMobility), have emerged that promote sustainable road transport and active mobility in the last few years. However, irrespective of the potential of eMobility, there are still few studies that examine individuals’ intention and adoption of eMobility-sharing services in smart communities. Accordingly, this study aims to develop a model grounded on the Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) theory to investigate the factors that impact individuals’ adoption of eMobility-sharing service and how to improve the adoption of eMobility-sharing service. A mixed-mode methodology was employed; quantitative data from survey questionnaires were used to gather data, and Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) was used to analyze the data. Additionally, qualitative data via interview was collected to demonstrate in ArchiMate modeling language how eMobility-sharing services are practically implemented as a use case study within smart communities. Findings from this study offer a model that focuses on eMobility-sharing adoption from the perspective of smart communities. Additionally, the findings offer a better understanding of how such integrated, multimodal systems fit with the sustainable mobility needs of citizens. More importantly, general recommendations to policymakers and practitioners to increase the uptake of shared eMobility are provided.

Data-Driven Approach for Urban Micromobility Enhancement through Safety Mapping and Intelligent Route Planning,"Micromobility responds to urban transport challenges by reducing emissions, mitigating traffic, and improving accessibility. Nevertheless, the safety of micromobility users, particularly cyclists, remains a concern in urban environments. This study aims to construct a safety map and a risk-averse routing system for micromobility users in diverse urban environments, as exemplified by a case study in Lisbon. A data-driven methodology uses object detection algorithms and image segmentation techniques to identify potential risk factors on cycling routes from Google Street View images. The ‘Bikeable’ Multilayer Perceptron neural network measures these risks, assigning safety scores to each image. The method analyzed 5321 points across 24 parishes in Lisbon, with an average safety score of 4.5, indicating a generally safe environment for cyclists. Carnide emerged as the safest area, while Alcântara exhibited a higher level of potential risks. Additionally, an equation is proposed to compute route efficiency, enabling comparisons between different routes for identical origin-destination pairs. Preliminary findings suggest that the presented routing solution exhibits higher efficiency than the commercial routing benchmark. Risk-averse routes did not result in a substantial rise in travel distance or time, with increments of 7% on average. The study also contributed to increasing the existing amount of cycle path data in Lisbon by 12%, correcting inaccuracies, and updating the network in OpenStreetMap, providing access to more precise information and, consequently, more routes. The key contributions of this study, such as the safety map and risk-averse router, underscore the potential of data-driven tools for boosting urban micromobility. The solutions proposed demonstrate modularity and adaptability, making them fit for a range of urban scenarios and highlighting their value for cities prioritizing safe, sustainable urban mobility.

A Spatio-Temporal Task Allocation Model in Mobile Crowdsensing Based on Knowledge Graph,"With the increasing popularity of wireless networks and the development of smart cities, the Mobile Crowdsourcing System (MCS) has emerged as a framework for automatically assigning spatiotemporal tasks to workers. The study of mobile crowdsourcing makes a valuable research contribution to community service and urban route planning. However, previous algorithms have faced challenges in effectively addressing task allocation issues with massive spatial data. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to the spatiotemporal task allocation problem using a knowledge graph. Firstly, we construct a robust spatiotemporal knowledge graph (STKG) and employ a knowledge graph embedding algorithm to learn the representations of nodes and edges. Next, we utilize these representations to build a task transition graph, which is a weighted and learning-based graph that highlights important neighbors for each task. We then apply a simplified Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and an RNN-based model to enhance task representations and capture sequential transition patterns on the task transition graph. Furthermore, we design a similarity function to facilitate personalized task allocation. Through experimental results, we demonstrate that our solution achieves higher accuracy compared to existing approaches when tested on three real datasets. These research findings are significant as they contribute to an 18.01% improvement in spatiotemporal task allocation accuracy.

Renovation or Redevelopment: The Case of Smart Decision-Support in Aging Buildings,"In Germany, as in many developed countries, over 60% of buildings were constructed before 1978, where most are in critical condition, requiring either demolition with plans for redevelopment or renovation and rehabilitation. Given the urgency of climate action and relevant sustainable development goals set by the United Nations, more attention must be shifted toward the various sustainability aspects when deciding on a strategy for the renovation or redevelopment of existing buildings. To this end, this study focused on developing a smart decision support framework for aging buildings based on lifecycle sustainability considerations. The framework integrated digital technological advancements, such as building information modeling (BIM), point clouds processing with field information modeling (FIM)®, and structural optimization, together with lifecycle assessment to evaluate and rate the environmental impact of different solutions. Three sustainability aspects, namely, cost, energy consumption, and carbon emissions, were quantitatively evaluated and compared in two scenarios, namely, renovation, and demolition or deconstruction combined with redevelopment. A real building constructed in 1961 was the subject of the experiments to validate the framework. The result outlined the limitations and advantages of each method in terms of economics and sustainability. It was further observed that optimizing the building design with the goal of reducing embodied energy and carbon in compliance with modern energy standards was crucial to improving overall energy performance. This work demonstrated that the BIM-based framework developed to assess the environmental impact of rehabilitation work in aging buildings can provide effective ratings to guide decision-making in real-world projects.

These spaces can sense, interpret, recognize user behavior, adapt to preferences, and provide natural interactions between humans and intelligent systems, using the IoT, AI, computer vision, data analytics, etc., to create dynamic and adaptive environments in real time. The integration of ISs and I5.0 has paved the way for the development of cognitive factories, which transform industrial environments into ISs. In this context, this article explores the convergence of IS and I5.0 concepts and aims to provide insights into the technical implementation challenges of cognitive factories. It discusses the development and implementation of a laboratory replica of a cognitive cell as an example of a segment of a cognitive factory. By analyzing the key points and challenges associated with cognitive cell implementation, this article contributes to the knowledge base surrounding the advanced manufacturing paradigm of I5.0.

Drivers’ Experiences and Informed Opinions of Presence Sensitive Lighting Point towards the Feasibility of Introducing Adaptive Lighting in Roadway Contexts,"Applications of adaptive and intelligent lighting technologies such as presence sensitive lighting, potentially offer solutions for reducing the energy consumption of road lighting while maintaining user comfort and safety. However, little is known about road users’ experiences of such lighting. To address this gap, we conducted a real-world case study of a presence sensitive roadway lighting on a collector road in a housing area in southern Finland. New, controllable LED lighting with PIR (passive infrared) presence sensors was implemented along the road, and test scenarios were designed, programmed, and tested. The lighting was adapted both to motor vehicles using the road and to the measured traffic density along it. Drivers’ experiences and attitudes toward the lighting were collected in a three-phase evaluation with questionnaires from the community of about 1000 households using the road as part of their daily mobility. The results indicate that as an experience, presence sensitive lighting in a road environment was at least as positive as traditional, uncontrolled lighting. User experiences of presence sensitive lighting did not differ from the experiences of uncontrolled lighting regarding pleasantness, uniformity, glare, and road visibility. Most of the drivers (86%) did not notice any dynamic change in the lighting. When informed about the tested lighting strategies, most of the participants (72%) would prefer either one of the intelligent lighting modes to be the permanent lighting solution. The results of this exploratory, real-world study point towards the potential feasibility of this technology from a user experience perspective, as the experienced stability of the lighting was unaltered in the tested scenarios; importantly, it also highlights the need to study adaptive roadway lighting further, especially through confirmatory studies in controlled settings.

The Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Assessment of User Routes in Shared Mobility Systems in Smart Cities,"The use of artificial intelligence in solutions used in smart cities is becoming more and more popular. An example of the use of machine learning is the improvement of the management of shared mobility systems in terms of assessing the accuracy of user journeys. Due to the fact that vehicle-sharing systems are appearing in increasing numbers in city centers and outskirts, and the way vehicles are used is not controlled by operators in real mode, there is a need to fill this research gap. The article presents a built machine learning model, which is a supplement to existing research and is updated with new data from the existing system. The developed model is used to determine and assess the accuracy of trips made by users of shared mobility systems. In addition, an application was also created showing an example of using the model in practice. The aim of the article is therefore to indicate the possibility of correct identification of journeys with vehicles from shared mobility systems. Studies have shown that the prediction efficiency of the data generated by the model reached the level of 95% agreement. In addition, the research results indicate that it is possible to automate the process of evaluating journeys made in shared mobility systems. The application of the model in practice will facilitate management and, above all, it is open to further updates. The use of many machine learning models will allow solving many problems that will occur in an increasing number of smart cities.

Route Planning for Emergency Evacuation Using Graph Traversal Algorithms,"The automatic identification of various design elements in a floor-plan image has gained increasing attention in recent research. Emergency-evacuation applications can benefit greatly from automated floor-plan solutions, as they allow for the development of horizontal solutions instead of vertical solutions targeting a specific audience. In addition to that, current evacuation plans rely on static signs without taking into account the dynamic characteristics of each emergency case. This work aims to extract information from a floor-plan image and transform it into a graph that is used for pathfinding in an emergency evacuation. First, the basic elements of the floor-plan image, i.e., walls, rooms and doors, are identified. This is achieved using Panoptic-DeepLab, which is a state-of-the-art deep neural network for the panoptic segmentation of images, and it is available from DeepLab2, an image segmentation library. The neural network was trained using CubiCasa5K, a large-scale floor-plan image dataset containing 5000 samples, annotated into over 80 floor-plan object categories. Then, using the prediction of each pixel, a graph that shows how rooms and doors are connected is created. An application that presents this information in a user-friendly manner and provides graph editing capabilities was developed. Finally, the exits are set, and the optimal path for evacuation is calculated from each node using Dijkstra’s algorithm.

An Incident Detection Model Using Random Forest Classifier,"Traffic incidents have adverse effects on traffic operations, safety, and the economy. Efficient Automatic Incident Detection (AID) systems are crucial for timely and accurate incident detection. This paper develops a realistic AID model using the Random Forest (RF), which is a machine learning technique. The model is trained and tested on simulated data from VISSIM traffic simulation software. The model considers the variations in four critical factors: congestion levels, incident severity, incident location, and detector distance. Comparative evaluation with existing AID models, in the literature, demonstrates the superiority of the developed model, exhibiting higher Detection Rate (DR), lower Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), and lower False Alarm Rate (FAR). During training, the RF model achieved a DR of 96.97%, MTTD of 1.05 min, and FAR of 0.62%. During testing, it achieved a DR of 100%, MTTD of 1.17 min, and FAR of 0.862%. Findings indicate that detecting minor incidents during low traffic volumes is challenging. FAR decreases with the increase in Demand to Capacity ratio (D/C), while MTTD increases with D/C. Higher incident severity leads to lower MTTD values, while greater distance between an incident and upstream detector has the opposite effect. The FAR is inversely proportional to the incident’s location from the upstream detector, while being directly proportional to the distance between detectors. Larger detector spacings result in longer detection times.

Microgrids Resiliency Enhancement against Natural Catastrophes Based Multiple Cooperation of Water and Energy Hubs,"With the ever-growing frequency of natural catastrophe occurrences such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, etc., the idea of resilient microgrids (MGs) has attracted more attention than before. Providing the opportunity for a multi-carrier energy supply after a natural catastrophe can lessen power losses and improve power resiliency and reliability. Critical loads within the MG can be prioritized and restored in the shortest possible time based on the condition of the network after the damaging occurrence by considering the energy hub (EH) systems and the optimum design and allocation of these multi-carrier systems. To this end, this paper aims to address the resilience framework in MGs considering sets of water and EHs (WEHs) consisting of CHP (combined heat and power), a boiler, energy storage, and a desalination unit. This study focused on considering an effective resilient scheme to restore critical loads in a short period after a natural catastrophe when the MG experiences an unpredictable event. By applying the idea of WEHs, there would be a chance of restoring the system by using two sets of WEH systems in the appropriate islanded points to restore the system and critical loads of electricity, heat, and water. For this purpose, different scenarios were considered for assessing the resiliency of the system against a natural catastrophic event that causes serious damage to the network by analyzing the energy-not-supplied (ENS) factor. Moreover, the allocated WEHs can adequately supply the electrical, water, and thermal demand loads throughout the day after the natural catastrophe. To mitigate the unforeseen variations in the renewable sources, a battery is located in the WEH, which can attend to the optimal scheduling effectively. A scenario-based method is also introduced to improve the resiliency of MGs in an uncertain environment such as electrical, heat, and water stochastic demands. The appropriate efficiency of the offered model was considered on a modified IEEE test system.

Smart City Assessment in Developing Economies: A Scoping Review,"There are limited research articles that focus on smart city assessment (SCA) applications as it is a relatively new field of research and practice. However, numerous studies have been conducted and published to date, particularly in developing countries, with the broad objective of building theoretical frameworks that are centered on smart city assessments. This study aimed to systematically examine the available literature on SCA, particularly in the context of developing economies, and provide valuable insights for the various stakeholders involved in smart city projects. The specific objectives of the study were to synthesize the existing literature on smart city assessment in developing economies, analyze the frameworks employed for smart city assessment, and identify critical gaps in these frameworks while providing recommendations for future research. The methodology employed involved a scoping review procedure, and the data that were collected and analyzed were specific to developing economies. The findings revealed that SCA often incorporates other research methods, such as mixed and quantitative analyses, and embraces a multidisciplinary approach that encompasses various subject areas. While social science emerged as a prominent subject area, sustainability, renewable energy, and industrial development also play crucial roles in smart city assessments. This study highlighted that ISO 37122:2019 is the most widely adopted framework due to its structured methodology, ability to measure progress over time, and potential for benchmarking against other cities. However, it is important to consider that each framework has its own strengths and weaknesses, and cities may opt to utilize multiple frameworks or tailor them to their specific needs. Our paper concludes by emphasizing the significance of this research in providing comprehensive insights into smart city assessment in developing economies and the need for further studies to address the identified gaps and enhance future assessments.

Smart Cities—A Structured Literature Review,"Smart cities are rapidly evolving concept-transforming urban developments in the 21st century. Smart cities use advanced technologies and data analytics to improve the quality of life for their citizens, increase the efficiency of infrastructure and services, and promote sustainable economic growth. Smart cities integrate multiple domains, including transportation, energy, health, education, and governance, to create an interconnected and intelligent urban environment. Our research study methodology was a structured literature review using Web of Science and Google Scholar and ten smart city research questions. The research questions included smart city definitions, advantages, disadvantages, implementation challenges, funding, types of applications, quantitative techniques for analysis, and prioritization metrics. In addition, our study analyzes the implementation of smart city solutions in international contexts and proposes strategies to overcome implementation challenges. The integration of technology and data-driven solutions in smart cities has the potential to revolutionize urban living by providing citizens with personalized and accessible services. However, the implementation also presents challenges, including data privacy concerns, unequal access to technology, and the need for collaboration across private, public, and government sectors. This study provides insights into the current state and future prospects of smart cities and presents an analysis of the challenges and opportunities they present. In addition, we propose a concise definition for smart cities: “Smart cities use digital technologies, communication technologies, and data analytics to create an efficient and effective service environment that improves urban quality of life and promotes sustainability”. Smart cities represent a promising avenue for urban development. As cities continue to grow and face increasingly complex challenges, the integration of advanced technologies and data-driven solutions can help to create more sustainable communities.

DC Microgrids: A Propitious Smart Grid Paradigm for Smart Cities,"Recent years have seen a surge in interest in DC microgrids as DC loads and DC sources like solar photovoltaic systems, fuel cells, batteries, and other options have become more mainstream. As more distributed energy resources (DERs) are integrated into an existing smart grid, DC networks have come to the forefront of the industry. DC systems completely sidestep the need for synchronization, reactive power control, and frequency control. DC systems are more dependable and productive than ever before because AC systems are prone to all of these issues. There is a lot of unrealized potential in DC power, but it also faces some significant challenges. Protecting a DC system is difficult because there is no discrete location of where the current disappears. DC microgrid stability that is dependent on inertia must also be considered during the planning stage. The problems that DC microgrids have include insufficient power quality and poor communication. The power quality, inertia, communication, and economic operations of these value streams, as well as their underlying architectures and protection schemes, are all extensively discussed in this paper. This review paper examines the pros and cons of both grid-connected and isolated DC microgrids. In addition, the paper compares the different kinds of microgrids in terms of power distribution and energy management agency, such as the prerequisites for a DC microgrid’s planning, operation, and control that must be met before state-of-the-art systems can be implemented.

E-Governance in Smart Cities: Global Trends and Key Enablers,"A smart city is a complex concept that can be analyzed from different aspects and points of view. E-governance plays a key role in facilitating the integration of all elements of a smart city. The purpose of the article is to investigate key enablers of e-governance in terms of economic, social, political, information and technological indicators. The research base includes 68 smart cities selected on the basis of different regional affiliations and different economic, social and political developments. The authors apply the methods of cluster analysis (to divide smart cities into clusters according to e-governance indicators); construction of an integral indicator using the linear mathematical model and the Fishburn formula; VAR/VEC modeling (to stud the key factors influencing the development of e-government in smart cities). It was found that the Human Development Index has the greatest impact on e-governance, while the GNI per capita indicator demonstrated the absence of influence for all clusters. The factor of information technologies was defined as the main factor of direct influence on the Smart City Governance Index for smart cities of the first cluster with the highest indicators of e-governance.

Optimization Approaches for Demand-Side Management in the Smart Grid: A Systematic Mapping Study,"Demand-side management in the smart grid often consists of optimizing energy-related objective functions, with respect to variables, in the presence of constraints expressing electrical consumption habits. These functions are often related to the user’s electricity invoice (cost) or to the peak energy consumption (peak-to-average energy ratio), which can cause electrical network failure on a large scale. However, the growth in energy demand, especially in emerging countries, is causing a serious energy crisis. This is why several studies focus on these optimization approaches. To our knowledge, no article aims to collect and analyze the results of research on peak-to-average energy consumption ratio and cost optimization using a systematic reproducible method. Our goal is to fill this gap by presenting a systematic mapping study on the subject, spanning the last decade (2013–2022). The methodology used first consisted of searching digital libraries according to a specific search string (104 relevant studies out of 684). The next step relied on an analysis of the works (classified using 13 criteria) according to 5 research questions linked to algorithmic trends, energy source, building type, optimization objectives and pricing schemes. Some main results are the predominance of the genetic algorithms heuristics, an insufficient focus on renewable energy and storage systems, a bias in favor of residential buildings and a preference for real-time pricing schemes. The main conclusions are related to the promising hybridization between the genetic algorithms and swarm optimization approaches, as well as a greater integration of user preferences in the optimization. Moreover, there is a need for accurate renewable and storage models, as well as for broadening the optimization scope to other objectives such as CO2 emissions or communications load.

Small-Scale Ship Detection for SAR Remote Sensing Images Based on Coordinate-Aware Mixed Attention and Spatial Semantic Joint Context,"With the rapid development of deep learning technology in recent years, convolutional neural networks have gained remarkable progress in SAR ship detection tasks. However, noise interference of the background and inadequate appearance features of small-scale objects still pose challenges. To tackle these issues, we propose a small ship detection algorithm for SAR images by means of a coordinate-aware mixed attention mechanism and spatial semantic joint context method. First, the coordinate-aware mixed attention mechanism innovatively combines coordinate-aware channel attention and spatial attention to achieve coordinate alignment of mixed attention features. In this way, attention with finer spatial granularity is conducive to strengthening the focusing ability on small-scale objects, thereby suppressing the background clutters accurately. In addition, the spatial semantic joint context method exploits the local and global environmental information jointly. The detailed spatial cues contained in the multi-scale local context and the generalized semantic information encoded in the global context are used to enhance the feature expression and distinctiveness of small-scale ship objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on the LS-SSDD-v1.0 and the HRSID dataset. The results with an average precision of 77.23% and 90.85% on the two datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Optimization of Taxi Allocation for Minimizing CO2 Emissions Based on Heuristics Algorithms,"Recently, the rapid climate change caused by increasing CO2 emissions has become a global concern. Efficient transportation systems are necessary to reduce CO2 emissions in cities. Taxi services are an essential part of the transportation system, both in urban areas with high demand and in rural areas with inadequate public transportation. Inefficient taxi services cause problems such as increased idle times, resulting in increased CO2 emissions. This study proposes a taxi allocation model that minimizes taxi idle time costs for efficient taxi service operation. We also propose three heuristic algorithms to solve the proposed model. At last, we conduct a case study by using real taxi data in Nagaoka, Japan. By comparing the three algorithms, the dynamic greedy algorithm produced the best result in terms of idle time cost and CPU time. The findings indicate that by minimizing idle time costs and reducing the number of taxis, it is possible to achieve a significant 81.84% reduction in CO2 emissions within the transportation sector. Further, in order to estimate the idle time costs the sensitivity of demand is considered.

"Blue Seaports: The Smart, Sustainable and Electrified Ports of the Future","Seaports are at the forefront of global trade networks, serving as hubs for maritime logistics and the transportation of goods and people. To meet the requirements of such networks, seaport authorities are investing in advanced technologies to enhance the efficiency and reliability of port infrastructures. This can be achieved through the digitalization and automation of core systems, aimed at optimizing the management and handling of both goods and people. Furthermore, a significant effort is being made towards a green energy transition at seaports, which can be supported through marine renewable sources. This promotes energy-mix diversification and autonomy, whilst reducing the noteworthy environmental footprint of seaport activities. By analyzing these pertinent topics under the scope of a review of container-terminal case studies, and these ports’ respective contexts, this paper seeks to identify pioneering smart seaports in the fields of automation, real-time management, connectivity and accessibility control. To foster the sustainable development of seaports, from an energy perspective, the potential integration with marine renewable-energy systems is considered, as well as their capabilities for meeting, even if only partially, the energy demands of seaports. By combining these fields, we attempt to construct a holistic proposal for a “model port” representing the expected evolution towards the seaports of the future.

Innovations in Shared Mobility—Review of Scientific Works,"Shared mobility is developing at a very fast pace around the world, becoming an alternative to classic forms of travel and, according to the public, providing innovative services. In recent years, these innovative services have also gained wide interest among scientists from a multicriteria point of view. However, among the topics and reviews in the literature, no review paper considering shared mobility in terms of innovation was identified. This article’s research objective was to indicate the perception of innovation in shared mobility in scientific works. The results indicate that innovations in shared mobility are a niche topic considered in few scientific works. What is more, in most cases, shared mobility services are perceived as innovative in themselves without detailed service analysis. Moreover, the issues of open innovation, which are closely related to the concept of accessible Mobility as a Service system and smart cities, are often overlooked. In addition, there was no work identified that fully referred to all areas of innovative service. The article supports researchers in the determination of further research directions in the field of shared mobility and fills the research gap in the field of knowledge about open innovation, especially in the context of the development of shared mobility services in smart cities.

IoT-Based Waste Segregation with Location Tracking and Air Quality Monitoring for Smart Cities,"Massive human population, coupled with rapid urbanization, results in a substantial amount of garbage that requires daily collection. In urban areas, garbage often accumulates around dustbins without proper disposal at regular intervals, creating an unsanitary environment for humans, plants, and animals. This situation significantly degrades the environment. To address this problem, a Smart Waste Management System is introduced in this paper, employing machine learning techniques for air quality level classification. Furthermore, this system safeguards garbage collectors from severe health issues caused by inhaling harmful gases emitted from the waste. The proposed system not only proves cost-effective but also enhances waste management productivity by categorizing waste into three types: wet, dry, and metallic. Ultimately, by leveraging machine learning techniques, we can classify air quality levels and garbage weight into distinct categories. This system is beneficial for improving the well-being of individuals residing in close proximity to dustbins, as it enables constant monitoring and reporting of air quality to relevant city authorities.

Generating Natural Cities Using 3D Road Network to Explore Living Structure: A Case Study in Hong Kong,"Compared with administrative cities, natural cities can be generally referred to as the areas generated based on the density of different urban facilities (e.g., point of interest, road network, etc.). To some extent, natural cities are outperformed in some related urban studies, such as urban living structure analysis. Nevertheless, traditional ways of generating natural cities are mostly limited to the planar space. Modern cities such as Hong Kong are vertical cities with high buildings, 3D road networks and land uses. Therefore, traditional nature cities could be biased when applied to 3D cities. In this work, a 3D road network in Hong Kong is adopted to extract true road intersections and generate modified natural cities to explore urban living structures. Numerous living structure units are classified into two parts: tiny and serried ones representing natural cities and vast ones representing rural areas. The classification method applies head/tail breaks, and a clustering algorithm was fitted for heavy-tailed distribution. According to the living structure theory, the living structures of the proposed natural cities and traditional natural cities based on the same road network in Hong Kong are compared. The findings show that the distribution of modified natural city regions is more reasonable compared with typical ones. The improved model will more clearly show the inherent living structure of the city and will allow an analysis of the relationship between the part and wholeness of the city.

A Cloud-Based Data Storage and Visualization Tool for Smart City IoT: Flood Warning as an Example Application,"Collecting, storing, and providing access to Internet of Things (IoT) data are fundamental tasks to many smart city projects. However, developing and integrating IoT systems is still a significant barrier to entry. In this work, we share insights on the development of cloud data storage and visualization tools for IoT smart city applications using flood warning as an example application. The developed system incorporates scalable, autonomous, and inexpensive features that allow users to monitor real-time environmental conditions, and to create threshold-based alert notifications. Built in Amazon Web Services (AWS), the system leverages serverless technology for sensor data backup, a relational database for data management, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for data visualizations and alerts. A RESTful API allows for easy integration with web-based development environments, such as Jupyter notebooks, for advanced data analysis. The system can ingest data from LoRaWAN sensors deployed using The Things Network (TTN). A cost analysis can support users’ planning and decision-making when deploying the system for different use cases. A proof-of-concept demonstration of the system was built with river and weather sensors deployed in a flood prone suburban watershed in the city of Charlottesville, Virginia.

"From Traffic Congestion to Sustainable Mobility: A Case Study of Public Transport in Odesa, Ukraine","Consistent and reliable information on passenger traffic is considered crucial for the efficient operation of the public transport (PT) network. The PT network is used to improve public services and thus attract more passengers. This study evaluated the passenger traffic in Odesa, Ukraine, due to the inefficient urban transport system. The main aim of this study was to make PT better by examining passenger distribution on traffic routes and specifying characteristics of PT travel influencing individual satisfaction. The metric-tabular method was used to collect data and examine the number of incoming and outgoing passengers at each bus stop. The results of the passenger and PT analysis provide valuable recommendations for optimizing future routes. It is beneficial for transport companies to implement such recommendations so that inefficient transport on the route can be reduced by either reforming the route network or choosing the optimal number of buses. According to the findings of this study, understanding PT services is the most important determinant of PT adoption. The main implications of the findings are of particular interest to policymakers who develop policies in the field of passenger transport and also to transport scientists and students.

"The Metaverse as a Virtual Model of Platform Urbanism: Its Converging AIoT, XReality, Neurotech, and Nanobiotech and Their Applications, Challenges, and Risks","With their exponentially rising computational power, digital platforms are heralding a new era of hybrid intelligence. There has recently been much enthusiasm and hype that the Metaverse has the potential to unlock hybrid intelligence. This is premised on the idea that the Metaverse represents an applied convergence of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) and Extended Reality (XR) that intersects with urbanism in terms of the distinctive features of platform-mediated everyday life experiences in cities. However, social interaction and its resulting social organization in the Metaverse are mediated and governed by algorithms and thus submitted to—a dream of—complete logical ordering. This raises a plethora of concerns related to the systemic collection and algorithmic processing of users’ personal, brain, and biometric data, i.e., profound societal—and the hardest to predict ethical—implications. Therefore, this study analyzes and synthesizes a large body of scientific literature on the unfolding convergence of AIoT and XR technologies, neurotechnology, and nanobiotechnology in the realm of the Metaverse in order to derive a novel conceptual framework for the Metaverse as an envisioned virtual model of platform urbanism. Further, it examines the key challenges and risks of these converging technologies in relation to the Metaverse and beyond. This study employs thematic analysis and synthesis to cope with multidisciplinary literature. The analysis identifies seven themes: (1) Platformization, (2) platform urbanism, (3) virtual urbanism, (4) XR technologies, (5) AIoT technologies, (6) neurotechnology, and (7) nanobiotechnology. The synthesized evidence reveals that, while neurotechnology and nanobiotechnology have numerous benefits and promising prospects, they raise contentions and controversies stemming from their potential use to inflict harm to human users—if left unchecked—through the black box of the algorithmic mediation underpinning the Metaverse. The findings serve to steer the Metaverse to contribute to human flourishing and wellbeing by adhering to and upholding ethical principles as well as leveraging its underlying disruptive technologies in meaningful ways. They also aid scholars, practitioners, and policymakers in assessing the pros and cons of these technologies, especially their inevitable ramifications.

Perceptions and Attitudes toward Risks of City Administration Employees in the Context of Smart City Management,"Smart cities are required to be effectively and efficiently managed in order to ensure the desired level of sustainability and quality of life for all inhabitants. This is a particularly difficult challenge in crisis situations of considerable scale and intensity (for example, the COVID-19 pandemic, armed conflicts, social tensions). For this reason, the aim of this article is to identify the attitudes and perceptions of risk by city administration employees combined with an assessment of their impact on the consequences of risk (the implementation of internal and external threats). The analyses used the results of a survey conducted on a representative sample of 399 Polish municipal offices, as well as descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling. The obtained results show that: (1) employees of municipal offices negatively perceive risk and are aware of its destructive impact on the organization, but are reluctant to report the risks; (2) individual and collective measures are taken in offices to protect against risks, but employees are not always encouraged to report potential sources of risk (rarely in the form of an informal conversation and even more rarely in a systemic form); (3) for the most part, employees are aware that internal and external risks have a negative impact on the operation of municipal offices; (4) the consequences of risks are more strongly influenced by employees’ perceptions of risk than by individual, team, and systemic attitudes toward risk. The added value of the research presented in this article comes from diagnosing the behavioral aspects of urban risk management and assessing the impact of attitudes toward risks and risk perceptions (internal and external) in a broad, representative range.

The commercial principles of dynamic pricing systems are often kept secret; however, their application causes complex changes in human behavior. Thus, a scientific tool is needed to evaluate and predict the impact of dynamic pricing strategies. Publications in the field lack a common quality evaluation methodology, public data, and source code, making them difficult to reproduce. In this paper, a data-driven method, DPRank, for evaluating dynamic pricing systems is proposed. DPRank first builds a surrogate price elasticity of demand model using public data generated by a hidden dynamic pricing model, and then applies the surrogate model to build an exposed dynamic pricing model. The hidden and exposed dynamic pricing models were then systematically compared in terms of quality using a Monte Carlo simulation in terms of a company’s revenue. The effectiveness of the proposed method was tested on the dataset collected from the website of a Russian railway passenger carrier company. Depending on the train type, the quality difference between the hidden and exposed models can vary by several dozen percent on average, indicating the potential for improving the existing (hidden) company’s dynamic pricing model.

Stormwater Sewerage Masterplan for Flood Control Applied to a University Campus,"Floods generated by rain cause significant economic and human losses. The campus of the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral (ESPOL) has a drainage system that conducts stormwater to two discharge points outside the campus. The system works effectively at the macro-drainage level. However, a very crowded area is deficient at the micro-drainage level, which has registered flooding and the proliferation of vectors that affect people’s health. This work aimed to design a masterplan for stormwater sewerage by analyzing the existing situation and applying technical criteria that allow the establishment of solutions and strategies to control floods at the university campus. The methodology consisted of: (i) data collection and processing for the stormwater drainage system diagnosis; (ii) a design proposal for micro-drainage and (iii) a SWOT analysis to propose improvement strategies in water management. The resulting flows for return periods of 5 years, 10 years, and 25 years are 9.67 m3/s, 11.85 m3/s, and 15.85 m3/s, respectively. In the latter, as the most critical area (presence of flooding), the implementation of a trapezoidal channel 80.20 m long, with a capacity of 1.00 m3/s, for a return period of 25 years was proposed. The stormwater masterplan will contribute to the execution of activities within the campus and prevent accidents and the proliferation of diseases, constituting a water-management model that can be replicated locally, regionally, and internationally.

Blockchain-Based Business Process Management (BPM) for Finance: The Case of Credit and Claim Requests,"Because of the competitive economy, organizations today seek to rationalize, innovate, and adapt to changing environments and circumstances as part of business process improvement efforts. The strength of blockchain technology lies in its usage as an apt technology to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes; furthermore, it prevents the use of erroneous or obsolete data and allows sharing of confidential data securely. The use of superior technology in the execution and automation of business processes brings opportunities to rethink the specific process itself as well. Business processes modeling and verification are essential to control and assure organizational evolution, therefore, the aim of this paper is three-fold: firstly, to provide business process management patterns in finance, based on blockchain, specifically for the loan-application process in the banking industry and claim process in the insurance industry that could be used and customized by companies; secondly, to critically analyze challenges and opportunities from the introduction of such approach for companies, and thirdly, to outline how companies can implement the loan business process as a web service. Partner companies (a bank and an insurance company) formulated the potential requirements for M2P along with the application of blockchain technology. An experimental design framework was established that gave the necessary services to model the requirements, check the models, and operationalize the models. The applied research methodologies are as follows: design science research paradigm and software case study, model-to-programming (M2P) of business processes, and utilization of patterns of workflow and blockchain.

Can Bike-Sharing Reduce Car Use in Alexandroupolis? An Exploration through the Comparison of Discrete Choice and Machine Learning Models,"The implementation of bike-sharing systems (BSSs) is expected to lead to modifications in the travel habits of transport users, one of which is the choice of travel mode. Therefore, this research focuses on the identification of factors influencing the shift of private car users to BSSs based on stated preference survey data from the city of Alexandroupolis, Greece. A binary logit model is employed for this purpose. The estimation results indicate the impacts of gender, income, travel time, travel cost and safety-related aspects on the mode shift, through which behavioural insights are derived. For example, car users are found to be twice as sensitive to the cost of BSSs than to that of car. Similarly, they are highly sensitive to BSS travel time. Based on the behavioural findings, policy measures are suggested under the following categories: (i) finance, (ii) regulation, (iii) infrastructure, (iv) campaigns and (v) customer targeting. In addition, a secondary objective of this research is to obtain insights from the comparison of the specified logit model with a machine learning approach, as the latter is slowly gaining prominence in the field of transport. For the comparison, a random forest classifier is also developed. This comparison shows a coherence between the two approaches, although a discrepancy in the feature importance for gender and travel time is observed. A deeper exploration of this discrepancy highlights the hurdles that often occur when using mathematically more powerful models, such as the random forest classifier.

"Mechanical, Structural, and Environmental Properties of Building Cements from Valorized Sewage Sludges","Building materials can enable the recycling of sewage sludge from tannery wastewater treatment by infiltration/percolation over coal and clay waste. The process avoids energy-intensive operations and yields a stable and environmentally friendly product. The sludge under study is mainly composed of SiO2, CaO, Al2O3, and Fe2O3, which is convenient to replace the mortar in cement. Different mortars were made by substituting a variable amount of sludge, from 0 to 30%, into the standard cement. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the mortar specimens were characterized after curing for 7 days and 28 days. The best properties were obtained with 15% sludge. Above 15%, the strength decreases at an early stage, as confirmed by SEM and XRD analysis, with more voids and ettringites at larger sludge content. The leaching tests of the mortar confirm that the cumulative values of heavy metals are far below the Deutsch regulatory limits (NEN 7043), justifying retention of the metals in the matrix. Radiological assessment of the sludge mortars also confirms their safety with the values of naturally occurring radioactive materials, surface radon exhalation and annual effective dose far below the required limits. The study suggests that 15% sludge can be used to sustainably replace cement and meet building safety requirement standards.

Intelligent and Environmentally Friendly Solutions in Smart Cities’ Development—Empirical Evidence from Poland,"This study presents a comprehensive analysis aiming to identify the implementation level of intelligent and environmentally friendly solutions (IEFS) in cities in Poland, and barriers impeding their development. Based on a representative sample of 280 cities, it was evident that the implementation level of IEFS in Poland is relatively very low. The most common barriers to IEFS implementation as indicated by representatives of city authorities were high costs, lack of adequate funds, and lack of awareness of benefits resulting from applying IEFS. Nevertheless, regression analyses showed that the IEFS implementation level was mostly affected by cities’ population size and perception of individual IEFS as integral elements of the smart city concept. It was also revealed that the high costs of implementing IEFS, the lack of their inclusion in local development strategies, the lack of appropriate legal regulations, the lack of widespread good practices, and the resistance of inhabitants to change and to new technologies perceived as impediments had significant negative effects on the implementation level of specific IEFS. Furthermore, the analyses demonstrated that perceiving certain issues as barriers did not hinder the implementation of such solutions. Based on a discussion of the results, relevant recommendations and directions for future research are proposed.

Factors Affecting Car-Sharing Services,"Car-sharing systems, i.e., short-term car rental services, are solutions indicated as an alternative to individual motorization; they can be used in an increasing number of cities around the world. These services, along with their intensive development, are becoming more and more complex. Due to their complexity, they involve not only an increasing number of stakeholders or infrastructure elements, but also indicate numerous links with the functioning of cities, especially smart cities. To properly implement or improve the car-sharing system, both in terms of operational issues regarding the system’s functioning or changes in the vehicle fleet, it is important to be familiar with the elements that make up car-sharing, as well as the factors that affect it. This work aims to present the factors affecting car-sharing, as well as the transport model of car-sharing services. This work fills the research gap stemming from the lack of comprehensive studies and knowledge on car-sharing. A detailed analysis of the literature shows that there are six main groups of factors affecting car-sharing: economic and technical, transport, social, environmental, organizational, and other issues; among these factors, more than 150 quantitative and qualitative criteria can be distinguished. Furthermore, the work also showed factors that are a niche in the literature and can be the basis for further research on car-sharing. Detailed familiarity with these factors could translate into increased profitability and, above all, success in the functioning of on-the-market services. This article supports the implementation and improvement of car-sharing services. In addition, it supports scientists in the preparation of scientific papers and mathematical models in the field of car-sharing and the factors that affect it.

Camera-Based Smart Parking System Using Perspective Transformation,"The concept of the “smart city” has emerged with the advancement of technology, but some facilities are not sufficiently intelligent, such as parking lots. Hence, this paper proposes an inexpensive and plug-to-play camera-based smart parking system for airports. The system utilizes inverse perspective mapping (IPM) to provide an aerial view image of the parking lot, which is then processed to extract parking space information. The system also includes a guidance system to assist drivers in finding available parking spaces. The system is simulated on a 3D scene based on the parking lot of Macao International Airport. In the experiment, our system achieved an accuracy rate of 97.03% and a mean distance error of 8.59 pixels. This research study shows the potential of enhancing parking lots using only cameras as data collectors, and the results show that the system is capable of providing accurate and useful information. It performs well in parking lots with open space, in particular. Moreover, it is an economical solution for implementing a smart parking lot.

Understanding the Links between Diversity and Creativity as Assessed in the Boroughs of London,"This paper analyses the links between creativity and diversity in the different boroughs of London. Based on rich data from the UK Census of Population of 2011 and other sources, we specifically analysed the correlations between creativity and diversity within the London boroughs. The main results of this study indicate that there is no direct correlation between creativity and diversity. Some significant correlations have been observed, however, between variables that shape such indices. Namely, the “creative class” tend to live in more diverse, more heterogeneous neighbourhoods (alongside people from many different countries) and they are more prepared to tolerate such diverse environments. The study also shows that diversity of geographical origin (measured by country of origin) is a more relevant factor for boosting creativity than variables such as religious diversity. This article contributes to the theoretical field of research exploring the impact of diversity on creative people and cities.

AHSS—Construction Material Used in Smart Cities,"With the level of development of the smart city, there are more and more research sub-areas in which the latest material and technological solutions are used, enabling the proper management and functioning of these cities. On the one hand, the introduced materials and technologies are designed to facilitate the functioning of residents both in the urban space and at home; on the other hand, the implemented solutions strive to be consistent with the principles of sustainable development. As shown in this article, reports on new technical and technological solutions and their positive and negative effects are strongly emphasized in publications on the development of smart cities. The most highlighted materials research in the smart city area concerns smart materials and their characteristics and applications. A research gap in this area is in the presentation of material solutions, particularly materials intended for the load-bearing structures of vehicles (electric vehicles, flying vehicles) or infrastructure elements (buildings, shelters, etc.) designed to increase the durability of the structure while reducing its weight. This paper aims to comprehensively present the most important research areas related to the functioning of smart cities in light of previous research, with particular emphasis on new material solutions used for thin-walled load-bearing structures in smart cities made of AHSS (advanced high-strength steel). These solutions are very essential for smart cities because their use allows for the installation of additional devices, sensors, transmitters, antennas, etc., without increasing the total weight of the structure; they reduce the number of raw materials used for production (lighter and durable thin structures), ensure lower energy consumption (e.g., lighter vehicles), and also increase the passive safety of systems or increase their lifting capacity (e.g., the possibility of transporting more people using transports at the same time; the possibility of designing and arranging, e.g., green gardens on buildings; etc.). AHSS-welded joints are usually characterized by too-low strength in the base material or a tendency to crack. Thus, the research problem is producing a light and durable AHSS structure using welding processes. The research presented in this article concerns the possibility of producing welded joints using the Metal Active Gas (MAG) process. The test methods include the assessment of the quality of joints, such as through visual examination (VT); according to the requirements of PN-EN ISO 17638; magnetic particle testing (MT); according to PN-EN ISO 17638; and the assessment of the selected mechanical properties, such as tensile strength tests, bending tests, and fatigue strength checks. These methods enable the selection of the correct joints, without welding defects. The results have a practical implication; advanced production technology for obtaining AHSS joints can be used in the construction of the load-bearing elements of mobile vehicles or parts of point infrastructure (shelters, bus stops). The obtained joint is characterized by adequate strength for the production of the assumed structures. The originality of the manuscript is the presentation of a new, cheaper, and uncomplicated solution for obtaining an AHSS joint with good mechanical properties. The application of the presented solution also contributes to sustainable development (lower fuel and material consumption use by mobile vehicles) and may contribute to increasing the load capacity of mobile vehicles (the possibility of transporting more people).

European Union Smart Mobility–Aspects Connected with Bike Road System’s Extension and Dissemination,"The analysis of scientific research described in peer-reviewed journals demonstrates the significance of bicycle road networks in relation to smart mobility. This research was conducted for European Union cities that meet the criteria of having a developed bicycle route network and are ranked among the top 100 European bicycle-friendliest cities in 2021. The study also analyzed whether each city was on national or international lists of smart cities or had smart city initiatives. The study indicates that a comprehensive and well-developed network of bicycle paths is a crucial element in the development of smart mobility solutions within a modern smart city. Among EU countries, cities in northern and central Europe, particularly in Germany, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and the Netherlands, have the best-developed bicycle networks. The research on the correlation between the average temperature level in a country and the average values for smart city bike lanes showed a statistically significant negative correlation between the two variables. The lower a country’s average annual temperature, the more that a bicycle infrastructure is present in its smart cities, as measured by the length of bicycle paths and the saturation of the city with bicycle paths per square kilometer and per 1000 residents. After removing outliers (Finland, Ireland, and Luxembourg), a significant relationship was observed between the wealth of a country and the length and density of bicycle paths in smart cities. The linear correlation coefficient between the length of bicycle roads and GDP per capita was found to be −0.73, which is a high coefficient value.

Design and Implementation of a Real-Time Crowd Monitoring System Based on Public Wi-Fi Infrastructure: A Case Study on the Sri Chiang Mai Smart City,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant changes in many aspects of daily life, including learning, working, and communicating. As countries aim to recover their economies, there is an increasing need for smart city solutions, such as crowd monitoring systems, to ensure public safety both during and after the pandemic. This paper presents the design and implementation of a real-time crowd monitoring system using existing public Wi-Fi infrastructure. The proposed system employs a three-tiered architecture, including the sensing domain for data acquisition, the communication domain for data transfer, and the computing domain for data processing, visualization, and analysis. Wi-Fi access points were used as sensors that continuously monitored the crowd and uploaded data to the server. To protect the privacy of the data, encryption algorithms were employed during data transmission. The system was implemented in the Sri Chiang Mai Smart City, where nine Wi-Fi access points were installed in nine different locations along the Mekong River. The system provides real-time crowd density visualizations. Historical data were also collected for the analysis and understanding of urban behaviors. A quantitative evaluation was not feasible due to the uncontrolled environment in public open spaces, but the system was visually evaluated in real-world conditions to assess crowd density, rather than represent the entire population. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of leveraging existing public Wi-Fi infrastructure for crowd monitoring in uncontrolled, real-world environments. The monitoring system is readily accessible and does not require additional hardware investment or maintenance. The collected dataset is also available for download. In addition to COVID-19 pandemic management, this technology can also assist government policymakers in optimizing the use of public space and urban planning. Real-time crowd density data provided by the system can assist route planners or recommend points of interest, while information on the popularity of tourist destinations enables targeted marketing.

"Smart Solutions for Municipal Flood Management: Overview of Literature, Trends, and Applications in German Cities","The paper outlines the challenges municipalities face when it comes to dealing with flood disasters and identifies general concepts for smart solutions that address the challenges and help cities to improve their flood resilience. It follows a unique and novel transdisciplinary approach in that it condenses the scientific literature to the most salient concepts in the fields of big data, digital twins, and remote sensing and support. As for big data applications, their main improvement to conventional flood management stems from the integration of different data streams to improve situational awareness. Digital twins not only help to improve the speed and quality of management decisions by visualizing complex data in a simple and accessible way during a disaster; they can also simulate the evolution of a disaster while taking into account the unique characteristics and conditions of a city, thereby acting as a critical element of an early warning system. Remote sensing and support with UAV solve the problem of physical and informational access to a disaster zone. In conclusion, the paper shows that smart solutions can be of great benefit for flood management, and that cities should strive to enhance existing infrastructure and processes with digital technologies.

Trustworthy Users: Using IOTA and IPFS for Attribute Validation in CP-ABE and dCP-ABE Schemes,"Attribute spoofing is a major security threat in information exchange solutions based on Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based-Encryption (CP-ABE) and distributed CP-ABE (dCP-ABE), which can compromise privacy and security. This threat occurs when an attacker forces the Attribute Authorities to generate keys for attributes they do not possess. This paper analyzes the threat of attribute spoofing and identifies the primary attack vectors, including direct interference with the Attribute Authority and compromise of the shared attribute storage database. The authors propose a solution based on IOTA, a DAG-type DLT, and Interplanetary File System (IPFS) to prevent attribute spoofing. The solution requires distributed attribute storage, validation, and user authentication to counteract the two attack vectors effectively. The proposed solution mitigates the consequences of attribute spoofing, including privilege escalation and reduction, acquisition of private keys, and cutoff of data access. The authors also evaluate their proposal through a value-chain use case and conclude that it effectively mitigates the consequences of attribute spoofing.

ChronoEOS 2.0: Device Fingerprinting and EOSIO Blockchain Technology for On-Running Forensic Analysis in an IoT Environment,"In industrial environments there are critical devices, so their correct operation must be ensured. In particular, having a secure record of the different events related to these devices is essential. Thus, this record can be used in future forensic investigations in case of accidents or production failures. In this sense, blockchain technology can bring reliability to the event log. In this paper, ChronoEOS 2.0, an extension of ChronoEOS, is presented. This new version can record the events that occur in multiple industrial robotic arms by deploying a Smart Contract in the EOSIO blockchain so that all events are immutably recorded in the blockchain. Furthermore, the new version allows using a unique fingerprint of the robot before registering an event in the blockchain. This fingerprint depends only on the characteristics of the operation and configuration of the robot. For this reason, ChronoEOS 2.0 not only increase the ability of ChronoEOS in terms of handling multiple devices but also increases the security and reliability of the operations. Finally, in this study, we verify that the new improvements have little impact on the hosting resources (RAM and Network are not altered, while CPU consumption is slightly higher due to the device fingerprinting module).

Based on our “smart governance toolbox”, we assess the variety of tools available for professionals to initiate and support multi-stakeholder collaboration by reviewing academic and grey literature. This review results in the identification of a broad range of tools that research and practice have developed. However, we also demonstrate that certain parts of the ‘smart governance toolbox’ remain almost empty: there are few tools for assessing the smart collaborative governance context, facilitating the collaborative structure, tackling technology issues, and measuring outcomes of smart city practices. Future design research should focus on developing instruments needed to make the smart governance toolbox complete.

Involvement of Local Authorities in the Protection of Residents’ Health in the Light of the Smart City Concept on the Example of Polish Cities,"According to the modern guidelines of the Smart City (SC) concept, smart cities are not only cities that are above average in terms of technology, but first and foremost are focused on the needs of their residents. A key need for quality of life is taking care of health, including education, prevention, and access to medical infrastructure. In the context of the given circumstances, this article seeks to answer the following research question: What is the level of involvement of local authorities in protecting the health of residents in Polish cities in the context of the Smart City concept? The involvement of local authorities in healthcare is considered in five aspects: (1) monitoring of residents’ health needs; (2) health education; (3) preventive healthcare; (4) healthcare infrastructure; and (5) environment and recreation. To obtain answers to the above research problem, surveys were conducted at the local government level in 399 Polish cities. The research utilized statistical measures of central tendency, indices of variation, and measures of interdependence. The results allow formulating the following key conclusions: (1) most of the surveyed cities do not monitor the health needs of their residents, contrary to the recommendations of the SC concept; (2) cities take measures to protect the health of their residents, but these are focused on sports and recreation; (3) the most neglected health areas are health education and environmental and climate protection. The level of involvement of the city authorities in protecting the health of residents is therefore quite low and is mainly image-related. The lack of monitoring of the expectations of the local community has a negative impact on the effectiveness of healthcare activities and the real improvement in the quality of urban life. Meanwhile, according to research results, cooperation with residents and care for meeting their needs is an important determinant of the effectiveness of healthcare. Given the above conditions, it is difficult to be effective both in terms of improving the quality of life of residents and developing fully sustainable smart cities. The research also shows that the involvement of the city authorities in holistic pro-health activities increases with the size of the city, which means that larger entities are more aware of cooperation with stakeholders and the importance of health for quality of life. Therefore, they are better prepared to implement the assumptions of the Smart City concept. The originality and scientific value of the conducted analysis will help fill the research gap in identifying the health determinants of Smart City development and assessing the involvement of city authorities in protecting the health of residents in a multifaceted perspective.

Guidelines for Renewal and Securitization of a Critical Infrastructure Based on IoT Networks,"Global warming has increased uncertainty regarding managing traditional water supply systems. Unfortunately, there is a need for the smart management of water supply systems. This work aims to design a solution for renewing and securing critical infrastructure that supplies water and provides water purification inside the range of applications of Industry 4.0 for Smart Cities. Therefore, we analyze the renewal requirements and the applicable use cases and propose a solution based on IoT networks for critical infrastructure in the urban environment. We describe the architecture of the IoT network and the specific hardware for securing a water supply and wastewater treatment chain. In addition, the water level control process for the supply chain and the system that ensures the optimal level of chemicals for wastewater treatment are detailed. Finally, we present the guidelines for infrastructure operators to carry out this operation within Industry 4.0, constituting a development framework for future research on the design of Smart Cities.
