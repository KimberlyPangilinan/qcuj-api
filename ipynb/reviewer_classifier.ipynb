       "  'abstract': \"Call center agents work in a telephone call center where they receive calls from customers inquiring about a product or service and make outgoing calls to current and potential customers. They must assist customers in a variety of areas, including billing, service issues, and orders, log calls made or received, and enter customer data into a specialized database. Additional responsibilities, such as sales and customer retention, are performed on a computer at a workstation or cubicle by agents in a call center. The majority of the work utilizes computers, software applications, and the internet. They are essential to the existence of all of these call centers. The issue at hand is whether there are labor productivity trade-offs and whether human labor has been replaced by technology. In light of this, this paper will discuss the factors that contribute to the labor productivity of call center agents in Metro Manila, resulting in an increase in employment despite the reliance on technology. Others believed that technological progress paved the way for the replacement of human labor, thereby decreasing the number of employed people or increasing unemployment. Unobserved in the paper's findings was a direct relationship between an increase in labor productivity and a rise in unemployment. In this study, the authors employed qualitative research characteristics, such as the relationship between researcher and participant. Qualitative research always gathers verbal and open-ended information. Former students of UDM's Marketing course, the participants are currently employed in Metro Manila as marketers. In this paper, agents from a call center demonstrated that human labor is still the master of technology and that their efforts are required to produce more output and services. Labor productivity equals the sum of human labor or labor resources, technological innovation, and capital expenditures.\",\n",

The following hypothesis shall be tested at 0.05 margin of error. There is no significant difference in the respondents' assessment of the effectiveness of electronic wallets as an alternative cash transaction of Quezon city university entrepreneurship students in the new normal when they are grouped according to the profile of the respondents. The researcher used a descriptive method for the research, to gather information about the present existing condition. The researcher decided to use the sampling technique by selecting at least 250 students as respondents. The respondents' demographic profile comprises the following: age, gender and college year level. The sampling techniques are non-probability sampling techniques used when respondents are chosen because of their appropriateness in the conduct of a study. This is designed to have general description of the effectiveness of electronic wallets as an alternative cash transaction for Quezon city university entrepreneurship students. The researcher used systematic random sampling for Quezon city university entrepreneurship students who have been into online classes. The gathered data from respondents were tabulated and interpreted. The main instrument used in the collection of data was a structured google form survey questionnaire. The questionnaire was a pattern up to the questions used in a relevant study. The questionnaire was formulated based on the related literature gathered. The instrument was divided into three (3) parts. The first part depicts the demographic profile of the respondents which includes their age, sex and year level. The second part of the questionnaire is about the respondent's assessment of the effectiveness of electronic wallets as an alternative cash transaction for Quezon city university entrepreneurship students in the new normal. The third part delves into the significant differences between the respondents. The gathered data from respondents were tabulated and interpreted.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"In the Seafarer's Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS 74) program, there is no mention of how seafarers will be protected from dangerous diseases, including the COVID 19 virus. The Philippines, according to The World Bank's 2014 report for the East Asia Region, has the highest absolute rate of maritime casualties, which is 40 % higher than Indonesia, which ranks second. According to World Bank data, 228 ships are involved in accidents and 303 people are killed annually in the Philippines. Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) reported in 2019 that the number of maritime accidents investigated increased from 2016 to 2019: 2016 43 cases, 2017 - 48 cases, 2018 -152 cases, and 2019-148 cases, for a total of 391. 273 of these incidents are classified as serious accidents. In order to promote safety aware- ness, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) mandated that all ship owners require all seafarers to complete the SOLAS program before joining the vessel. To evaluate the program, the CIPP model will be applied while surveying and collecting data from the three types of respondents: one administrative member of the Maritime Institute, two retired seafarers, and six active seafarers. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the SOLAS74 program's impact on the careers of seafarers and to propose a risk reduction management model to enhance the SOLAS program, which will ensure the protection of seafarers during pandemics at sea.\",\n",

On its 25th Founding Anniversary in April 2020, UDM, implemented a repositioning strategy to adhere to its original mission as the preeminent science and technology higher education institution in Manila, with Education 4.0 as the focal point of its core course offerings. The Universidad de Manila Portal was designed for current and prospective students and faculty. The Universidad de Manila Portal ena- bled faculty members to perform a variety of academic-related tasks, including viewing course ad- mission lists/status, the academic calendar, lectures, and grades/performance. Beyond class hours, the portal facilitates communication between professors and students. This study is an initi- ative usability analysis to determine the needs of the UDM community and expand the University Information and Communications Technology Office's service offerings (ICTO). The study deter- mined the Faculty Portal's usability in terms of its features and frequency of use. This serves as the foundation for enhancing the university-wide Faculty Portal usage policy.\",\n",

Ugbo Street Food is one of the famous places in Tondo, Manila that offers numerous food stalls that serve inexpensive snacks and desserts until the late hours of the night. The goal of the study is to increase awareness towards health-related concerns associated with food safety and sanitation on eating street foods and to promote Ugbo Street food as one of the famous food destinations. 411 food aficionados completed a 39-likert type survey developed by the researchers. The instrument was validated by industry and food experts and has a Cronbach\\'s Alpha of 0.966. The customers rated sanitation of service area and equipment, food handling and customer service, and pest and waste man- agement of the food establishments in Ugbo, Tondo Manila to be \"very good\", especially on food visibility and equipment. Items on food preparation such as exposure, cooking, and han- dlers\\' sanitation practices ranked lowest. Significant differences (p<.05) were found in the as- sessment based on the respondents\\' frequency of visit, companions, amount spent, and edu- cational attainment. This shows that food safety and sanitation were not consistently prac- ticed. The researchers suggest that owners and food handlers be given formal trainings and certification, and that barangay health authorities to regularly monitor compliance to ensure consumers\\' safety and sustainability of micro-businesses.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Puerto Princesa City, Palawan is known for its tourism attractions from the time the Under- ground River was included in the seven wonders of nature around the world. The enormous in- crease of tourist visitors resulted in increa tourism-related businesses. Financial institutions start- ed to proliferate as well and it plays a very significant role in the tourism industry by providing fi- nancial services to tourism-related businesses. The study gathered data on the profile of tourism-related business in terms of its capital structure, management and employment. Likewise, data was also gathered to describe the profile of financial institutions in terms of classifications and products and services offered. The study was conducted to determine the economic link between tourism related businesses and financial institutions. It aimed to determine the opportunities and problems affecting the growth of the tourism related businesses and financial institutions. Moreover, it was conducted to determine how the products and services of the financial institutions help in the growth and development of tourism-related businesses. The study used purposive sampling with forty (40) respondents from tourism-related busi- nesses and fifteen (15) respondents from financial institutions. Survey questionnaire was used. The findings revealed that the increase of tourism-related businesses contribute to the development of the city in terms of employment. Moreover, it brought opportunities to financial institutions. Tourism-related businesses obtained its borrowings for its short term and long-term financing needs from banks and microfinance institutions. Banking institutions catered financial services to those who passed their standards while microfinance institutions catered to those who cannot pass the stringent qualifications of the bank. The existence of commercial banks was not really relevant to the development of eco-tourism business in the city as it is composed mostly of the micro and small businesses. Only one bank has offered a financial product designed to fit the current needs of the city for the recovery and development of its tourism sector. To be responsive to the needs of the city's eco-tourism industry, specifically tourism-related businesses in particular, a consultative process among various stakeholders composed of financial service providers, clients/users of financial services such as the tourism industry. government institutions, development partners and international organizations is needed to provide inputs and feedback, share knowledge, and come up with supports and initiatives such as helping the recovery and development of the city tourism through providing constant government intervention and financial service that is tailored fit to the needs of the tourism-related businesses.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Local Universities and Colleges (LUCs), being dynamic organizations, need educational leaders who can effectively implement necessary changes for institutional development. Due to demands for reform and accountability, LUCs must meet strict educa- tional standards or face serious consequences. Schools must find leaders that are not just willing, but able to face these challenges by successfully initiating change both for the im- provement of the system as well as its ultimate reform. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) promotes Institutional Sustainability Assessment (ISA) because it can serve as a learning process for the HEIs and contribute to its continuing quality cycle for its institutional development. In response to the lack of informed research concerning educational leadership styles correlating to institutional sustainability assessment and outcomes in LUCs, the researcher is motivated to pursue this study and aims to contribute to this pressing issue of LUCS for quality mechanisms, despite of its high political influences and bureaucratic system that affect or hinder the LUCs development. Hence, the purpose of the study is to determine the situational leadership style of the individuals most responsible for changing or maintaining a system and what factors might affect the ability of a person to make meaningful changes in a school setting and the relationship of these leadership styles to ISA Key Results Areas. Descriptive method was used in the study using the Leadership Style Instrument adopt- ed from Hershey and Blanchard and the Self-Evaluation Document of the CHED ISA adminis- tered to the LUCs Administrative and Academic Heads, using random sampling technique. The study revealed that coaching, delegating, and directing are the leadership styles exhibited by the school administrators to a moderate extent in a situation. This implies that development level of the subordinates is still in low level. The sampled LUCS \\'very often practiced\" the institutional sustainability indicators, as a whole. And, it is only the directing leadership style that has a significant positive relationship with governance (r=.224, >:.05); quality of teaching and learning (r=.255, >;.05); and exposure, research and creative work (240, .05). This implies that the increase in the use of directing leadership style will also increase the practice of institutional sustainability such as governance; quality of teaching and learning; and exposure, research and creative work.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The purpose of the study is to evaluate the physical plant and instructional support facilities of Diocese of Imus Catholic Educational System, Inc.. The study used descriptive research approach with the involvement of a total population of seven hundred ninety-three (793) Grade 10 learners, teachers, principals, and physical plant coordinators and were represented by two hundred sixty-two (262) randomly selected proportional respondents. The respondents provided commendable evaluation in varying degrees of their existing school building and facilities, space provisions, and safety, health, and well-being measures. There are, however, observed consistent lower acceptable ratings like the individual monitoring of cleanliness and sanitation of comfort rooms, ramps and lifts for physically impaired children, drainage and sewage system, properly labeled and barcoded equipment, well-planned entrance and exit points of the building and facilities, and space provisions for adequate clinic size. The respondents likewise provided varying assessment of within the acceptable limits for their schools' current instructional support facilities. Nonetheless, found with least ratings but still acceptable include emergency showers, functional exhaust fans, designation of qualified and well-trained laboratory aides, readily available first-aid supplies in chemistry laboratories, provision of updated computers with operation manual and software applications with license in computer laboratories; provision of separate rooms for boys and girls, adequate Personal Protective Equipment, and first-aid supplies for the TLE rooms. This is diverse appreciation of schools compliance to the prescribed standards for school buildings and facilities, space provisions and safety, health, and well-being. And except for schools' classrooms, appreciable differences in the evaluation of computer and science laboratories, TLE rooms, and libraries.\",\n",

Several human factors contribute to the low academic performance of students in the Philippines who are currently studying in the new normal setup or online learning. According to Rotas & Cahapay (2020), one of the main challenges that students are currently facing in the online learning setup is the overloaded lesson activities. This particular difficulty of having to submit unjustified load activities from different subjects in just a week makes the students feel that the value of learning in the lesson is lost and they are just doing the activity for the sake of compliance. This is why this study aims to analyze how human factors contribute to the academic performance of the 3rd year BSAMT students of PhilSCA. The results of this study will be used to make the proposed recommendatory framework on how to mitigate the contributions of selected human factors to a student's academic performance.\",\n",

Hence, course selection is one of many important choices that students will make in determining future plans. It becomes one of the biggest dilemma and challenge in any student's life. Hence, the study sought to investigate the course preference among students. The study used quantitative methods of data collection. The quantitative method was done through a survey questionnaire. The respondents are BSED major in English 2B and Science 2 majority are females, their parents' highest educational attainment finished Secondary Graduates have less than P11,690, monthly tuition and consist of 4 to 6 members. Findings revealed that employability, financial status, and availability of job are three of the most considered factors in choosing a college course among BSED English and Science students. It is also concluded that the factors affecting the course preference among students are less extent and that there are no significant differences on the course preference among respondents along all its demographic profile of the students. It is hereby recommended that students must have a clear understanding of what they really wanted in the future before choosing a course in college.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"In response to the educational challenges brought by the pandemic, the Las Piñas National High School (LPNHS) Almanza initiated a collaborative project dubbed as SHARE (Stakeholders' Hands-on Assistance in Remote Learning Engagement). The effectiveness of Project SHARE in the delivery of educational services through Modular Distance Learning was determined through a mixed-method explanatory research design. This investigation in- volved Grade 7 parents, GPTA officers, teachers, and advisers of Grade 7 learners at LPNHS - Almanza for School Year 2021-2022. The participants were askedto answer a 25-item survey questionnaire (using a 4-point Likert scale which ranged from 1=not satisfied to 4-highly satisfied) about their perceptions on the effectiveness of project SHARE. Focus group discussions with students, teachers, and GPTA officers were conducted to describe further their experiences on modular distance learning. Interviews with parents were likewise conducted to gather feedbacks on their involvement in project SHARE. Quantitative data from the survey were analyzed using descriptive statistics (frequency, mean and standard deviation), while the narrative data were subjected to qualitative data analysis. The results showed that the respondents are highly satisfied with the delivery of educational services in Modular Distance Learning in terms of the distribution and retrieval of Self Learning Modules (Mean= 3.872) and Learning Activity Sheets (Mean=3.876). Respondents were satisfied with the parent-teacher conference and with the aspect of motivating and encouraging learners. Major themes emerged from the FGDs with the respondents like self-approval for learners' development, active partners in terms of education support, and increased community involvement in the aspect of continuing education. Findings revealed that project SHARE has made a significant contribution to the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation of students to study in spite of the COVID-19 epidemic. Furthermore, project SHARE underscored the positive effects of parents' and teachers' partnership and cooperation regarding the leamers' education, wherein a strong parent-teacher partnership boosts learner achievement. Therefore, schools should have more programs that will encourage parents to be actively involved with their children's education. \",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The pandemic due to covid-19 virus has huge impact in the academic community. Many colleges, instructors, and students at all levels have been affected by the inability to move quickly to electronic and online learning environments. The number of colleges and universities offering distance education programs increased significantly around the world, and distance education has exploded in many countries. According to Mykhaylova (2021), the crisis has affected more than 1.37 billion students. Students have been forced to move from physical college campuses and adapt to modern online educational environments as a result of the advantages and disadvantages. They experienced anxiety, isolation, and confu- sion about what will happen with their classes, tests, graduation, and other significant events affecting their academic course, such as platform usability problems, despite possible Covid- 19 virus health risks. However, the hassle of commuting to school has been eliminated, and having the freedom to learn anytime and having enough rest and sleep has been possible, as well as keeping safe at home from the Covid-19 virus. Traditionally, edu- cators used distance learning to incorporate various learning methods into their lesson plans. The Covid-19 pandemic has made online learning mandatory, pushing schools and universities to quickly implement unprecedented strategies in their attempts to make distance education accessible, including creating an immediate learning environment in a setting that is distinct from conventional classrooms. Therefore, the researchers would like to determine the perspective of BSIT students on online learning based on their experience during its implementation and also identify their preferences. To help Quezon City University take action for better management of facilitating online classes. Since computers and technology are already part of the BSIT students; selected program at Quezon City University, the researchers also determined the impact of online learning to them using, as well as its advantages and disadvantages.',\n",

In this view, the Marikina Polytechnic College aims to design and develop a hybrid curriculum that could provide basic to advance skills in technical drafting technology with focus in construction industry. The curriculum is hybrid in terms of its framework, content and pedagogy, learning environment and modality, and assessment. The hybrid curriculum incorporates the TVET and CHED framework by following the Philippine Qualification Framework (PQF). It aims to provide a learning pathway for beginners and professionals who would like to pursue technical skills and professional development in architectural design, graphics and visual techniques and advanced building information mod- elling. This would provide an opportunity for learners to receive certification and qualification for competencies gained per course which is recognized by government institutions and private companies. Through series of planning and consultations, the Diploma in Construction Design and Technology Innovation program is developed and evaluated for implementation. The development process of the hybrid curriculum is a multi-phase and cyclical process which started from March 2021 to August 2022. This includes planning with the technical working committee; identifying key issues and trends in construction industry; assessing needs and issues; defining the diploma program coals and course objectives; curriculum mapping; and developing assessment instruments. This would serve as venue to provide flexible learning pathway to learners from diploma to higher education degree programs.',\n",

This paper is a comparative study of ethnic and national stereotypes and self-stereotypes of these three ethnolinguistic groups. Using a modified Katz and Braly trait checklist, as well as their uniformity index, this paper was able to: 1) determine the ethnic stereotypes of the said ethnolinguistic groups; 2) compare and contrast the uniformity as well as positivity of the three ethnic stereotypes; 3) determine the ethnic self-stereotypes of the same ethnolinguistic groups; 4) compare and contrast the uniformity as well as positivity of the three ethnic stereotypes with their corresponding ethnic self- stereotypes; 5) determine the national self-stereotypes of the three ethnolinguistic groups; and 6) compare and contrast the uniformity as well as positivity of the three national self-stereotypes with their corresponding ethnic self-stereotypes. This paper is significant in understanding the peaceful and productive co-existence of the said three ethnolinguistic groups not only in TSU but also in Tarlac City, and Tarlac Province. This paper is also significant in exploring how multi-ethnicity and multicultural condition may contribute towards imagining national identity and building the nation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Covid-19 has created unprecedented challenges economically, socially, and politically across the globe and caused an educational crisis. This study assessed the practices and resilience of the institution's responses to the pandemic from the lens of employees of a state college in Northern Mindanao, Philippines as a basis for strategic actions. This study employed quantitative and qualitative research methods with survey questionnaires/google survey forms, focused group discussions, and key informant interviews to one hundred- four employees. Analysis of the practices and resilience among faculty revealed an increase in teaching responsibilities, professional advancement, and creative work and advising responsibilities but a decreased time spent responding to learners' and colleagues' emotional and mental health needs. Both administration and faculty felt somewhat stressed; however, their work-life balance has improved substantially. The faculty workload has decreased significantly, job satisfaction has decreased, and caregiving responsibilities have stayed the same. As to the administration, there was an increased in job satisfaction; the workload remained the same, and caregiving responsibilities decreased somewhat. Both found a moderate extent of access to information, availability of resources, COVID-19 accommodations, and work adjustments. Themes or scenarios for strategic actions emerged as follows: orienting the employees of the plans and activities of the college towards crises; capacitating faculty and employees; education continuity plan; relevant curriculum; upgrading infrastructure; full support to disaster risk reduction management system; monitoring, evaluation and assessment of on-going responses to strategic actions; and inclusion of well-being, equity and crises plan to strategic plans.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Employees are the most valuable asset in an organization. Their skills, abilities, experiences and knowledge are necessary for the company to achieve their mission and goals and to maintain their market performance. Batram and Gibson (2000) claim that, training can sometimes be costly if the programs do not successfully align and match the requirements of the organization and the needs of the employees. Thus, Training Needs Analysis (TNA) must be done in a systematic way, or an organization may incur a loss if the requirements assessment is a failure. The main purpose of this study was to assess the type of training and support needed for the Engineering Instructors at Quezon City University (QCU) for them to develop their personal competencies, knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA), and to be able for them to contribute to the university's organizational goals and mission. The researcher utilized descriptive method and a survey questionnaire was administered to assess the type of training and support needed for the Engineering Instructors at QCU. Statistical treatment was applied to analyze data accurately and precisely. The findings clearly revealed that the subjects that are least taught includes information system, Ergonomics 2, and Operation Research 2; while in ECE is feedback and control sys- tems. Furthermore, it is obvious that the instructors of industrial engineering possess the greatest level of technical expertise in the field of industrial organization and management. They did, however, have the lowest level of information system understanding. On the other hand, ECE Instructors has the most expertise in electromagnetics, while they are least expert in Signals, Spectra, and Signal Processing subjects. In addition, IE Instructors are most interested in training related to Industrial Materials and Processes, while ECE Instructors are most interested in Feedback and Control Systems topics. The University must consider providing budget for the most preferred seminars/training of the instructors and should give emphasis on subjects that got the least expertise such as Information Systems and Signals, Spectra, and Signal Processing. Moreover, it is recommended that the location of the training/ seminar is at Quezon City University and the management should hire an external consultant or training specialists thru active-hands on participation, instructor-led, or study groups.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Research studies would typically highlight the arguments and points of concern raised by the student or group of students, which often come in the form of a societal problem or matters that are relevant to their chosen courses. In an article written by Oshitha Narangoda (2022) for Shorelight, he stressed how universities and colleges all around the world emphasize the importance of theses and the implications that their creation entails and how they can be used to solve problems and contribute to the existing body of knowledge. Soni et al. (2018) found in their study that electronic resources yielded favorable results for the scholars that used them, as they were able to find what they needed in a relatively short amount of time and with minimal delays between searches. The Thesis Repository System will act as a one-stop location for storing and viewing thesis outputs made by the AMT student body. It can be accessed by the AMT students in order to help with the creation of their own thesis outputs. Not only will it store thesis outputs, but it will display and categorize them in a manner that would make sorting and searching easier and more fluid, exceeding the description of a basic storage system.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Based on the Meta-Leadership Model of Marcus et al. (2007), as cited by Saltz (2017), this research documented and assessed the crisis leadership competencies and pandemic response strategies of school leaders in the DepEd Division of Northern Samar. Utilizing a sequential exploratory approach, qualitative and quantitative designs were adopted. In the qualitative component, eight (8) school leaders participated in face-to-face interview sessions, wherein the emerging themes from their responses highlighted the concept that meta-leaders have a higher effect than their real authority because they exert a strong influence on their followers, aiding them in overcoming obstacles and seizing opportunities. They understood the nature and significance of the situation, and in order to keep a diverse group of people on track, they weaved together key themes that highlighted the organization\\'s core purpose and ambitions. In the qualitative aspect, the broader population of 130 respondents answered a questionnaire about school leaders and; crisis leadership competencies, which revealed the following results: \"Very High\" on Team Leader- ship (AWM -3.25); \"High\" on Situational Awareness and Integrative Thinking (AWM =3.18); and \"High\" on Decisiveness and Emotional Effectiveness (AWM 3.24). In addition, respondents completed a questionnaire regarding the extent of the school leaders pandemic response strategies, which revealed the following findings: Promoting Organizational Resili- ence, \"Large Extent\" (AWM =3.24); Acting with Integrity, \"Very Large Extent\" (AWM =3.29); and Exhibiting Learning Orientation, \"Large Extent (AWM =2.96). Based on the results, the researcher contends that when establishing a crisis management plan for a successful pan- demic response strategy, school leaders must prioritize the following elements: communication, high productivity, technology use, and accessibility. On the basis of these factors, the current researcher proposes the following three focus areas for the crisis management plan: (1) establishing guidelines or policies for remote work for faculty and staff; (2) embracing remote work for department heads, master teachers, and focal persons; and (3) developing inclusive and collaborative virtual meetings. The researcher also suggests that school administrators think about adopting the recommended crisis management plan to make sure that all important aspects of the school system are taken care of.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A significant proportion of population in the Philippines has disabilities. Of this number, the highest percentage belongs to the 5-19 years old age group. From this number, the majority of these Filipino children with disabilities were not able to go to school or sustain school participation. Challenges included financial constraints faced by households or lack of access to educational facilities. Of the 136,523 children with special needs enrolled in special classes, 66,635, or 48.81% had disabilities. This study explored the experiences of differently-abled learners from the perspectives of the parents, the teachers, and the learners with disabilities themselves applying the ableism lens. Discourse analysis design was utilized for this study wherein ten participants from the Department of Education Schools Division of Nueva Ecija and comprising of three parents of differently-abled learners, three learners with disabilities, and four teachers were selected via purposive sampling. Semi-structured interviews were the main data-gathering tool while thematic analysis was used in analyzing the data. Findings revealed the following major themes; (1) a struggle for acceptance, respect and equality; (2) reinforcing ableism by prescriptive and restrictive norms; (3) ableism in spoken word through labeling; and (4) confident and achieving versus individuals with low self-esteem. Inclusive education has come a long way although, there are some obstacles to inclusive education. Policies must be revisited regarding the status of inclusive education and equal access to education programs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Working while taking classes is one of the most frequently cited reasons cited by univer- sity dropouts. As the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of teleworking by employers, online employment opportunities have increased. Given that the scenario allows students to work while studying online, determining the number and extent of employed students is an important area of research. This study aims to document the employment profiles of undergraduate students of Quezon City University. A total of 7,050 responses were received during the survey period. According to the findings of the study, approximately 15% of the respondents are employed full- or part-time. At the time of the survey, 64% of the working students who responded in the survey are working on-site, while 24% are working from home. Meanwhile, 50% of these working students are extremely satisfied with their current employment situation, while 44% are somewhat satisfied. In general, the majority of the respondents who are working students are pleased with their current employment situa- tion. Despite the fact that only two out of ten respondents are working students, the school administration must still pay close attention to this issue. The development of policies that will assist these students is required. For future studies, it is also important to examine employ- ment patterns among undergraduates and how these patterns vary over time and based on student characteristics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study was conducted to address some key problems in the process industry of Supply Chain Management (SCM) by developing optimization-based models, approaches and solution procedures using Set-Based Concurrent Engineering (SBCE). A supply chain is defined as \"a network of organizations that are involved, through upstream and downstream linkages in the different processes and activities that produce value in the form of products and services in the hand of the ultimate consumer (Christopher, 1998). Successful supply chains can significantly benefit the competitiveness of the firms. A supply chain may contain all activities that transform raw materials to final products and deliver them to the customers. A number of stages are involved in a supply chain, typically including suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, distribution centers, retailers, and customers. The material flows go through the supply chain from suppliers to customers, while the information flows of orders and demands are in an opposite direction. In today\\'s highly competitive and complex marketplace, a company with a more effective and efficient supply chain can have more advantage than its competitors. Thus, supply chain management, as a source of competitive advantage, has become a big challenge for the companies in different industries. By using Set-Based Concurrent Engineering (SBCE), technology plays an important role in order to make concurrent designs of product, process or services and making the needs more accessible and faster.',\n",

However, the lack or insufficient availability of learning resources for teaching skills, drawing technologies limits the achievement of subject goals and competencies. Research has also shown that physical school facilities are determinants to students' learning and better academic performance. It will be very difficult for students to learn well without the complete structures. Thus, such challenges paved the way for the design and development of glass drawing boards with digital led screens. The development offers a writing and drawing board with a variety of tools and technology access in a common set up. Technology faculty, students and other allied courses evaluated the project based on its functionality, aesthetics, workability, durability and safety with five (5) (outstanding) being the highest and one (1) (fair) being the lowest. The project then received an overall mean of 4.62, which implied acceptable results especially in terms of Durability (4.74) and functionality (4.69). Result shows that the students and professor respondents of the study are more preferable over the existing equipment. The developed Glass Drawing Board with Digital LED is an effective tool to be as an educational device specially for Drafting /Drawing and Engineering students, which can improve learning and produce creative works that demonstrate innovation. Further evaluation using other actors and criteria will be done to accommodate ease of use and convenience.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"One of the most profitable non-timber forest products worldwide is bamboo. The Philippines ranks sixth among the world's top exporters of bamboo and has been actively manufacturing and processing bamboo goods for pulp and paper, food, musical instruments, farm and fishing implements, building, furniture and handicraft manufacturing, as well as fuel for cooking and heating (DOST-PCAARRD, n.d.). That is to say, bamboo can be used for a variety of things. Hence, this project development research intends to design an ergonomic device that will aid artists and art students in performing their works. This versatile bamboo easel is intended for those who enjoy painting, particularly art students who cannot afford to purchase an expensive easel. People can maximize their limited living space by using the multifunctional Bamboo Easel.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This hoist motor side lifter is similar to other lifters, but it is more modern because it is equipped with a motor. It can help a lot when it comes to installation, specifically of air-conditioning units, at elevated positions. This is important for students and air-conditioning technicians because it can make their installation process easier. This hoist motor side lifter ensures the work of the technician or student to facilitate their installation because they no longer have to lift their materials manually. It is also safe to use compared to using a ladder while carrying an object or when working at elevated places. In addition, to facilitate smooth and fast movement of the lifter from one place to another, it was constructed with four wheels and a stopper. The hoist motor side lifter was designed with durable materials to withstand lifting heavy objects. This project can be exposed to sunny or rainy days because it is already covered with corrosion resistant paint. But, to prolong the life in which this lifter can be used in good condition, a clear coat was provided by the researchers. The hoist motor side lifter measures 201 cm tall and 108 cm wide. On the other hand, the platform of the motor is 100 cm by 30 cm. The overall appearance of the prototype is not far from the appearance of a forklift. The prototype was painted with the color blue and orange.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Educational institutions produce a wide selection of products, just like the fashion and garment industries do, for consumers' convenience and continual technical advancement. This machine's design utilizes a motorized mechanism and a simplified framework to effectively iron a range of materials, producing a higher-quality ironing device. This machine has the simplest ironing process to make the fabric smooth. The process of this machine is a steam type, where it needs to be filled with water in the lower part of the machine to produce a hot steamer that can be applied to ironing the fabric. The frame of the machine is made of acrylic fiber-glass to provide a strong cover for the machine. The study is done to build a more straightforward steam ironing machine in order to help the industry, students, and teachers produce high-quality output. When making apparel, students must solve a number of issues, including tangled fabric, can be solved by proper ironing. This prototype will be highly beneficial to its users. When mass producing garments with striped or plaid patterns, they may use it to make better clothing and help students and instructors in their projects. Additionally, it lessens the dangers of knotted clothing, which can damage certain parts of the garments. The new service promises to steam-iron the garment's small components, like the biases and the collar, collar stand, and sleeves. The project was evaluated based on its functionality, effectiveness, performance efficiency, usability, and safety with five (5) (outstanding) being the highest and one (1) (fair) being the lowest. The project then received an acceptable result in terms of its performance efficiency and functionality.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"This collaborative action research was conducted in response to the need of developing a corrective and progressive mechanics to address the issues relating to the non-performing engineering students with the end goal to expand and accelerate the acquisition of knowledge. The study was conducted in Quezon City University Main Campus where participants are engineering students, members of the faculty who collaborated during the intervention program with the supervision of University Officials including the College Dean of Engineering, the area Chair Persons, and the Research Management Office. This research was participated by 68 respondents during the initial phase and 77 respondents during the intervention program. Subjects involved were science, technology, engineering and mathe- matics. The study further employed the binary coding techniques to comply with data privacy law and research ethical standards. Moreover, the study used the categorizing, describing, analyzing and interpreting techniques for qualitative data analysis. After analyzing the data, the following recommendations were here to present. 1.) In the outset of opening of classes, students should be reminded of the policy on absences. They should be informed about the conflicts of schedule to their subject teachers to address the issues and concerns in dropping the subject. As much as possible, they should ask proper advice of the area chairpersons and the college dean if there are conflicts of schedule to prevent the occurrence of officially dropped (OD), Unofficially dropped (UD), and to prevent failing grade due to excessive ab- sences. A truancy report is a good mechanism to monitor student's absences before they eventually end up to OD or UD situation. 2.) In the early stage during the opening of classes, students should be re-oriented about the three (3) factors that are associated in the learning process and the learning capacity of students. They should be oriented to review the importance and application of prerequisite subjects which are necessary to improve their knowledge, skills and development of positive attitude towards the study of Sciences and Mathematics. They should also be oriented to review their knowledge and skills in outlining the concept mapping which are essentials of topic sequencing and relating these to a more advanced study of Sciences and mathematics subjects. Moreover, students should be re-oriented about the importance of constant practice in problem solving and analysis. 3.) The College of Engineering may consciously advocate a student-centered classroom environment that promotes corrective and progressive mechanics for non-performing students, average performing students, and better performing students respectively. This strategy was proven by many collaborative researches to expedite transfer of knowledge, to propagate expansion of knowledge and to accelerate acquisition of knowledge and skills through innovative ways of learning by using learning apps and wireless educational technologies. 4.) A similar study is highly recommended to look for other factors associated in the learning process and learning capacity not only of the non performing students but even good performing students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics subjects. This is also to maintain high quality standards of Quezon City University Engineering students that may lead them to a globally competitive graduate and to be future leaders in national development.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology instructors and students can use the functional pipe rotator for oxyacetylene welding with Variable Frequency Drive to perform cutting operations using an oxyacetylene supply intended for black and galvanized iron pipes. This pipe rotator for oxyacetylene welding will support faculty and students at Cavite State University - CCAT campus' BS Industrial Technology program in mastering the basics and functionalities of a VFD-controlled chuck in holding pipes. Overall, the equipment can be effectively used in applicable machine shop operations that are stated in this study. The BS Stationary Marine Technology and allied field instructors and students, as well as future researchers who will utilize this study as a foundation to improve or perform relevant research, will also be the direct beneficiaries of this research. The pipe rotator for oxyacetylene welding will be of great use as the program offers topics related to the metal cutting process. The developed pipe rotator for oxyacetylene welding with VFD is operated by properly placing the metal pipe on the three-jaw chuck. This is followed by aligning the oxyacetylene torch holder at an appropriate distance from the metal pipe, turning on the circuit breaker, and plugging in the power source. The Start Button is then turned on and the speed of the Variable Frequency Drive is adjusted accordingly. The operator needs to monitor the rotation of the metal pipe and check the condition of the chuck and wheel support. After opening the oxyacetylene supply, constant monitoring of the overall operation is required. This prototype is designed mainly for instructional operations for stationary marine and allied field instructors to teach the students to perform different processes involving oxyacety- lene cutting, holding metal pipes, and holding the oxyacetylene torch.\",\n",

The proponents came up with the idea and design based on what they experience dur- ing laboratory activities. The previous booth that was created is only half and open and there is a risk of students getting hurt while they are watching, so we made the booth especially for one student/teacher only inside so that we can eliminate the risk of other students being in- jured. The proposed design focused on observing the students inside the booth while they are conducting welding activity, to have a good type of communication between the students and the instructor inside and outside, and also to train their skills on welding by using the welding positioner. It is considerably efficient and useful in comparison with the previous booth made here in welding and fabrication technology.

The adaptive transition necessitated that Quezon City University redesign its syllabus, learning materials, teaching techniques, student engagement, and assessment systems. The primary goal of the researchers is to conduct an evaluation of the Readings in Philippine History modules currently used at the Quezon City University to provide inputs for enhancing the module. This study used a descriptive method to evaluate the module utilized in the Readings in Philippine History course and to provide future directions for the instructional materials in a flexible learning environment. One hundred ninety-seven (197) students were asked to evaluate the module in terms of language, content, and format. On the other hand, nine (9) faculty members evaluated the module's language, content, format, objectives, presentation, and usefulness. According to the analysis conducted using SPSS version 22 statistical software, both teachers and students rated the modules as satisfactory overall. The t-test for independent samples revealed that there is no significant difference between the evaluations of teachers and students in the language, content, and format of the modules. Despite the fact that the evaluation suggests positive results, the feedback from the respondents showed that there are aspects of the module that can be improved. As a result, the module's content, presentation, and usefulness need to be revisited and improved. Therefore, the validation of various learning tools, such as modules, should also be included in the process, as this ensures the quality of the educational material that is being provided.\",\n",

Having identified the issues of transnational families, the researcher proposed a program to address the issues in the transnational families in this study. The findings show that the rise of transnational families in which the husbands or wives need to work in other countries modifies the structure of the family. Households become fatherless or motherless while the grandparents, aunties, and uncles become the guardian or the head of the households. The condition of the households being left motherless or fatherless affirms the pervasiveness of transnational families, which in turn resulted in the new care roles, new parenting styles, and new support systems in the family structure. It is however interesting to note the patriarchal ideology as one of the enduring issues that run throughout the narratives of the informant; the kinship system as a push and pull factor of transnational families that strengthen their motivation to work abroad; and the functionalist theory that was manifested in the case of support system of these transnational families in maintaining the stability of the family as a primary institution. Consequently, an enrichment program for the community is needed to address the issues of transnational families, especially on the welfare of the children and the entire family.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Most studies in the field of positive psychology focused on psychological factors and their impact on mental health based on Western models and quantitative approaches (Datu, Bernardo & King, 2018). Thus, there is a need to further develop the knowledge and application of positive psychology concepts and theoretical models grounded in the lived experiences of the Filipino population. The present study utilized a qualitative research design, particularly a grounded theory method, to build a Filipino-based well-being model among university students. Findings of this research led to the formation of the BLOOMS Model of Well-being, which suggests that holistic well-being is composed of five interconnect- ed aspects (Academic, Psycho-emotional, Physical, Social, and Spiritual). Personal factors, social influences and unexpected life events were found to influence well-being. Strategies to enhance well-being were categorized into the following: Building (e.g., sleep), Leveraging (e.g., social connection), Owning (e.g., solitude), Opening (e.g. emotional expression), Molding (e.g., task management), and Self-enhancing (e.g. selfcare), leading to holistic growth. Data from this study will be used as basis for the development of a positive intervention program for university students with depressive symptoms. Findings endeavor to contribute to the limited local literature on positive psychology and provide psychologists with culturally-sensitive intervention approaches.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"In the course of life, educators try to update and get a grasp of the clientele they are engaged in. With the rapid influx of information through social media, it has been their preoccupation to fill in the gaps, without even realizing the reason why am I enjoying doing this. Discernment that includes - where they are, who is with them, where they have been, what am I doing, what are we doing and where they are heading. Perhaps, questioning - what is the purpose of my existence? Precepts that social media cannot answer. In the process of the study, the query, in turn, is how will the cultural identity be preserved in the influx of foreign influences brought about by an influx of information in the Philippine society? This could help and contribute to the development of the school curriculum as to the goals of the subject and the subject area. Eventually, this could help in the planning and development of the school. The layout could assess the existing programs relevant to the study. Furthermore, administrators could cascade this to the teachers in the different departments of specialization. Further, the following determinants were specifically assessed among the subjects' responses in a form of a quick survey. This includes the characteristics of our students based on their knowledge and affinity to the culture they were raised. Since the impact of the rapid turnout of the Digital Age was hypothesized, the factors that influenced the Filipino character were analyzed. The study was conducted at Cavite State University-CCAT Rosario Campus in Cavite, one of the satellites of the Cavite State University main campus. The respondents come from a Technology and Vocational course in their third year in college. The total number of respondents is fifteen (15). Based on the results, the young people of this generation are generally not too familiar with their roots, perhaps on the first level of awareness of their roots only. Custom, opinions, and position in the society also matter in posing generalizations among each other. Somehow, the environment is a factor that affects cultural identity and it is relative. Customs foster social harmony and unity within a group. It allows the opportunity to get influenced by their affinity. Furthermore, it provides important social and economic benefits. Improved learning and health increased tolerance, and opportunities to come together with others' cultures enhance our quality of life and increase overall well-being for both individuals and communities.\",\n",

The purpose of the study is to determine how and why communities in Ifugao continue to invest in social capital in their cultural practices. Ethnography, as a qualitative design, is the inquiry used in this study as it focused on explaining investing social capital along the three categories of bonding, bridging, and linking on selected Ifugao cultural events such as birthdays, engagements, marriages, and deaths. Participant observation along with interviews and coupled with focus group discussion are the tools used in collecting data. The data gathered were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings revealed that majority of the performers and participants are above 55 years old, male, married, college graduates, government employees, and have a monthly salary of over 40,000 Php. Most of the attendees to Ifugao birthdays, engagements, weddings, and death wakes perceived that non-monetary benefits were achieved such as strengthening bonds between families and close friends, bridging links with faraway friends, and connecting relationships with other participants. In terms of investment, wedding has a high cost, high return, and high return monetary value, while death has a low cost and high return monetary value. Ifugao (Tuwali) cultural community invest in social capital strengthen their families, friends, and communities' bonds, connections, trust, and reciprocity.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Philippine has approximately fourteen to seventeen million indigenous peoples ac- cording to the United Nations. Of all the ethno-linguistic groups in the country, the Sama Bad- jao are the most vulnerable, discriminated, exploited, and widely dispersed Muslim ethnic mi- nority in the Philippines. Conflict and poverty were the root cause of their dislocation and has led those once known as \"sea gypsies\" to other parts of the country seeking a better life. They were known as mendicants and were called by many derogatory names. Some of them found hope in Nueva Ecija and became beneficiaries of the housing program of the local govern- ment of Cabanatuan. Living in the resettlement site, the Sama Badjao led a peaceful life and free to practice their culture beliefs and customs. The purpose of the study is to explore the unique cultural beliefs and practices of the Sama Badjao regarding reproduction who are in the relocation site and describe how their status of living in the resettlement site is affecting or re-defining their concept of pregnancy and views on reproduction. This study presented the emic and etic views of the Sama Badjaos in the relocation site of Cabanatuan City regarding pregnancy, childbirth, and child care. The study utilized focused ethnography to achieve the purpose of this research. Eighteen (18) Sama Badjao were chosen as informants of the study using purposive sampling and snowball sampling. Short term immersion, participant observa- tion, formal and informal interviews, and examination of relevant documents were the instru- ments for data collection. The participants were composed of four (4) key informants and four- teen (14) informants. The findings revealed that almost all of the informant adhered some or most of beliefs and practice which were handed to them by their elders, specifically their mother. The pattern of teen pregnancies, early marriages, and home deliveries by the panday were still observed by the informants. On the other hand, the Badjao concept of menarche, the umboh (consulting departed relatives, and dowry system continue to have a prominent place in their society. The meeting of parents, the male circumcision, and the marriage ceremony are still celebrated public events of which everyone is expected to participate. Belief in the invisible entity umboh and the pag-umboh ritual are respected and observed. Insights on the richness of the concept of reproduction among the Sama Badjao may lead to revisiting the present BSN program and curriculum that will not only enrich the unique beliefs and practices of the Sama Badjao who were dispersed but will also provide culturally congruent nursing care at the same time.',\n",

The study utilized the Qualitative Research design. Under this design, an ethnographic approach employing focus group discussion and in-depth interview were carried out among 10 Samal Laud participants. The results revealed that majority of the participants experienced communication challenges in terms of tone, pronunciations, and fluency in speaking other dialects. Moreover, participants believed that learning is the best way to communicate with the other ethnic groups and learning how other tribes speak makes it easier to deal with in order to avoid being criticized. Based on the findings and conclusion of the study the following are recommendation: Government unit and non-government organizations must strengthen the participation of the Samal Laud to be part of the local projects like livelihood, community, engagement, and fun fares that will allow them to socialize with other people in order to boost their confidence and eventually improve their self-esteem and communication skills. Development communicators, must allow the Samal Laud to participate in the radio or television program for them to share their cultural backgrounds, ethnicity, and dialect and develop media output that would reach out the Samal Laud as part of the Department advocacy such as leaflet materials that would bear racial equality to bridge the gap between Samal Laud with the rest of the tribes.',\n",

The Philippines have the Sangguniang Kabataan as a venue for the youth to participate in governance and is guided by the Sangguniang Kabataan Reform Act of 2015. The research focused to study about the youth governance of selected barangays of Baguio City. Information from this study could help identify effective strategies for further improving youth participation without primarily relying on sports activities. The study utilized a descriptive qualitative approach, using key participant interviews, focus group discussions, and document analysis in data gathering. The data gathered shows that the Sangguniang Kabataan conducts youth profiling as a tool to identify the needs of the youth and start from there in creating projects and programs where it showed that there were many under active citizenship. The Sangguniang Kabataan employ different strategies in formulating and implementing projects and programs such as organizational partnerships, employing intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and having adaptability, resourcefulness, and commitment to serving and empowering the youth. Despite having great strategies there is still a problem in gaining youth participation due to having non -availability of other Sangguniang Kabataan leaders, inactive youth participation, challenge on budget, and lack of facilities and training. Several programs were designed by the researchers in order to address the challenges that transpired during the conduct of the study, these were: semestral general assembly, capacity building for Sangguniang Kabataan leaders and Katipunan ng Kabataan members, and the creation of a youth center.',\n",

The purpose of the study is to understand the gender perspectives of the learners through the theories of Social Learning and Transformative Learning. An open-ended questionnaire, final course project, and video recordings of synchronous classes were used to gather data from a class of first year students enrolled in GEE 1 course. The results indicate that learners used socio-psychological concepts to define gender; vary in their perceptions of men, women, and homosexuals; gender-related roles, practices, and concepts are learned from multiple sources, which are also the sources of discriminatory practices; and variations in experiences, observation skills, and language used in learning result in varying gender perspectives.

As COVID-19 continues to persist, uses of online platforms will still be the means in continuing education as mandated by the Philippine government. In response to the mandate, Wesleyan University-Philippines provided an Learning Management System (LMS) platform to be utilized by the students and faculty members.This initiative has brought a dramatic change in the educational landscape not only to both faculty and students who were on face-to-face learning modality but also students with distance learning. However, despite the positive praises induced by the LMS platform, students have faced a significant amount of hindrances that affect their experiences. This qualitative-phenomenological study explores the lived experiences of nursing students on the use of the LMS platform. A total of eight (8) participants, varying from 4-year levels, were interviewed using a semi-structured interview through a purposive sampling approach. In generating the study's main themes, data were analyzed meticulously using thematic analysis. Based on the thick narratives of the participants, there were eight (8) major themes derived: Learning Restrictions, Enhancing Experiences, Adopting Capabilities, Recurring Emotional Stress, Noticing Competencies, Impending Unfairness, Navigating Troubles, and Grasping Knowledge. The findings of this research study have recommended addressing the challenges and issues in using LMS by capacitating both students and faculty because online learning is the trend of education today.\",\n",

The researchers aim to design feasible agricultural information by crafting pamphlets and posters or Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials with agricultural information from the farmers of Buenakapok. This is subsequently one way of promoting and informing the youth about agriculture. The study utilized descriptive quantitative-qualitative design in establishing the needed data as it also employed purposive and snowball sampling technique. This study also determined the challenges encountered by the farmers relative to the ownership of agricultural land, the sources of agricultural information, the availability of support, and common agricultural practices. Common agricultural practices were seen by Buenakapok farmers as the most important issue among all other variables. However, Buenakapok is a developing community when it comes to agricultural farming as it gradually opens its doors to new possibilities like modern farming technology, attending agriculture seminars, and embracing new techniques in organic farming. Based on the results obtained by this study, a tri-fold pamphlet was crafted with six panels of agricultural information.

       "  'abstract': \"The primary aim of suicidology is to understand the phenomenon of suicide by increas- ing its predictability and prevention to reduce the suicide rate. However, the rate of suicide remained obstinately high. This phenomenological study explored the different perspectives of five suicide attempt survivors and seven mental health professionals on suicide recovery and its process. Phenomenological methods were used to analyze the participants' lived experiences through reduction, description, and finding the essence. Four essential elements emerged that elucidate these perspectives, vital in understanding suicide recovery, namely: (1) contextual elements: factors that describe how the participants view suicidality and suicide recovery; (2) facilitative elements: elements that lead to and affect the youths' suicide recovery; (3) impeding elements: factors that hinder suicide recovery; and (4) procedural elements: conditions that pertain to the steps in suicide management and intervention program. By integrating the findings of this current phenomenological study with the Inflorescence Model of Suicide Recovery, a suicide recovery paradigm was conceptualized. Exploring suicide recovery and its process showed some similarities and differences in these perspectives, contributing to the gaps or cracks in the health care system described to be fragmented. The findings were used to conceptualize the Inflorescence Suicide Management Program, which is a recovery-focused suicide management program. This program hopes to contribute to establishing a structured, systemic, and collaborative health care system, thereby strengthening suicide management care and reducing the suicide rate.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'As the world continues to expand and direct itself to new condition, the concept of globalization is inevitable. With the rise of technological transformation and popular culture, the world stage becomes widespread and demanding. For a developing country, like the Philippines, the popular demand is concerned with the process of living, i.e., employment and opportunities, since it is ubiquitous, due to its extensive population. In some ways, there has been a national crisis that Filipino people have been experiencing for years. It is not uncommon to see this in a broad picture, for there are factors that ought to consider. While factors are given within the study, the economic factor is the ultimate cause of why there exists such a problem. For many years, the general population of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) has grown in an equilibrium state, implying that labor migration is not a myth, resulting in the phenomenon of Brain Drain. Brain Drain is the efflux of professionals from developing countries to industrialized countries (Lu, 2014). As shown in the data, most of the Filipino workers who migrate overseas are land-based workers and are influenced by the specialization of elementary occupations. This study will show the total output of OFW, from 2014 to 2019, including the types of work, sexuality, popular destination, place of work, and specialization. This paper will reinstate the problem of developing countries, in terms of labor employment and lack of opportunities, and the different ways to address the problem of Brain Drain, as exemplified in the recommendation of the study.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"This study investigates the multimedia materials used and needs of the various government line agencies, industries, non-governmental organizations, media industry, and academic institutions. To answer the research questions, ten (10) heads/supervisor of offices were interviewed. This research study employed a qualitative research method. It sought to describe the multimedia related needs and demands of industries and agencies. The findings showed that the multimedia materials being used in the different agencies and industries were identified as printed media, online/modern media, broadcast media, and digital electronic devices. As a result, these media have given effective ways for agencies and industries to communicate with one another, allowing them to readily reach the people in terms of information transmission. On the other hand, industries/agencies' multimedia needs or abilities were related to information technology related skills; layout artist; videographer; photographer; and writer. They determined the multimedia demands or skills of the selected agencies in Zamboanga City with respect to the multimedia materials they used. This goes to show that the production of multimedia products, particularly in the visual arts, videographer, photographer, and writer skills are in high demand in industries, notably for printed media and other visual art related materials. Based on the results of the study, it is recommended that the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences to conduct multimedia related training to both faculty and students.\",\n",

Others with severe cases of the Covid-19 were seen to those affected individuals who are 60+ years old or to those patients who have pre-existing medical conditions such as heart diseases, cancers, diabetes, and other conditions that weakened the immune system. But even with severe medical conditions, there is still a slight chance of survival. On the other hand, those who were fortunate to survive even with serious illness are also faced with dire financial problems. The challenges experienced by Covid-19 patients classified as Covid-19 patients were worried about their jobs especially when they heard the news that the virus had already spread throughout the Philippines. The majority of the participants expressed their worries about their family, their safety, and their essential needs. The challenge of being in isolation prevented them from working. The number of days that Covid-19 patients spent in isolation had felt difficulties and hard times for them. This pandemic had taken a toll on most of the working families, experiencing low income, and even risking their lives for the sake of their families. The coping mechanisms of the participants in isolation and recovery especially the parents are their limited financial resources resulting in cutting back spending on food and reducing expenses.',\n",

The researchers based the parameters on copper corrosion test, flashpoint test, and viscosity test that was conducted on two samples made and formulated by the researchers themselves. The samples formulated were two batches, one having 20% ethyl alcohol concentration, while the other having 25% ethyl alcohol concentration. Procedure and other chemicals were based out of Flick E.W.'s formulation. The samples mentioned were sent and tested at the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Standards and Testing Division, and Adamson University Technology Research and Development Foundation. The results were analyzed by the researchers that led to the conclusion of the two samples being beneficial compared to commercially used degreaser. Results gathered for 20% concentration had a flashpoint of 180 deg Celsius, 407 cP for viscosity, and 1a for copper corrosion test. Twenty-five percent (25%) concentration had 170 deg Celsius flashpoint, 259 CP viscosi- ty, and 1a for copper corrosion test. efficacy was also tested by applying it to several hand tools. Documentations, pricing, and other details were included. This study is helpful to sever- al people and various industries, especially the aviation world. Furthermore, the researchers recommend this to be marketed in the future.\",\n",

The concept was suggested to be used in the field of industrial technology, especially in mechani- cal technology, the instructors and the students can become more effectively and efficiently do their tasks inside the workplace because of this technology. The design was considerably effective and usable for notching 90 degrees in rectangular tubular steel and the flat bar with the 2mm thickness. The design of the machine was so that the students and instructors of the industrial technology can become more productive. The result showed that pressure gauge between the hydraulic cylinder jack and hydraulic hose, polish the sharp edges, improve the output, and create a manual user. The hydraulic adjustable tubular notcher is efficient when notching a 45-degree angle in rectangular tubular steel. The prototype is particularly focused on notching a rectangular tubular steel in a 45-degree angle that can then be bent into a 90- degree angle. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The study aims to determine the adaptability of Urban Farming in Quezon City Govern- ment during the Pandemic. The urban farming offers the opportunity to provide fresh, local food to urban communities. However, urban farming can only be successfully embedded in urban areas if consumers perceive urban farming positively and accept urban farm in the community. The underpinning theoretical framework of this study is Social Practice Theory. For Social Practice theorists, actors create social structures through the social practices which they sustain and reproduce while simultaneously these practices are embedded into social structures. The concept of the study was based on the primary interested variables of the study, which is the assessment of urban farming practices in Quezon City. The respond- ents were individuals from different areas of Quezon City. There were 131 respondents who participated in the study. The researcher used a systematic random sampling to individuals from different urban farm residences in Quezon City. The study it concluded that despite of the educational attainment of the respondents, urban farming received a positive outlook from the community during the Pandemic. Urban farming will only be successful if it is accepted and perceived positively by those living in close proximity. Urban farming is more than just to bond with neighbors and preserve green spaces. It also provides communities with opportu- nities to learn about nutrition and growing food. Reweaving the urban farming through the fabric of today's society is being recommended. Likewise, the support of the government to urban food production is generally important.\",\n",

There were 350 participants of this study two hundred respondents (200) in Quezon City University, one hundred (100) respondents in Bestlink Colleges of The Philippines and fifty (50) respondents in New Era University. The questionnaire was used in data collection using Frequency and Percentage; Mean and Pearson’s Moment Correlation Coefficient. The statements of questionnaire were measured using five point Likert scale. Findings revealed there is a significant correlation on business competency and employment performance satisfaction in the area of adaptability and knowledge, adaptability and disciplinary skills as well as the rewards and recognition, employee well being and opportunity enhancement. The data revealed with a P value of 0.001 which is < the level of significance 0.05. This means that as knowledge of the graduates increases, their adaptability to the business environment also increases at a rate of about 29%. Likewise, when graduates adaptability to business environment increases, their disciplinary skills also increases Although these skills are a part of the collection of qualities that combine to make an individual employable, but this does not mean that these skills are as fixed as one’s physical attributes like height,weight,size or as difficult to change as the shape of one’s facial features like hair, birthmarks, eyes & nose. Employability skills can be acquired, developed and enhanced. There is clearly no set strategies, technique nor trick to inculcate these skills in an individual but an overall cooperative learning approach by the employers, academic institutions as well as the students together will work to have the competitive advantage in the job market. Therefore, the study aimed to determine work related skills, competencies ,employment satisfaction and the level of performance that affect the graduates employability, promotion by which work values and skills provided by the Academic Institutions contribute to the graduates employability.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The mango fruit (Mangifera indica) is one of the most abundant fruits in our country. Because of the growing demand for green chemistry in science and industry, the development of green corrosion inhibitors and green inhibition techniques has recently become extremely important. The use of plant extracts as metallic corrosion inhibitors has received a lot of interest in the last several decades. The research should also learn about corrosion control compounds and components, anti-corrosive performance, and the benefits and drawbacks of MIL extract. The Mangifera Indica Leaves extract includes functional groups that can neutralize oxygen during its interaction with other molecules  according to FTIR testing (Fournier-Transfer Infrared Spectroscopy). The salt spray testing result is \"No observable defects,\" indicating that the coating effectively protected the aluminum alloy against HCL damage during immersion. The Weight-Loss Method was used on the non-coated and coated samples with varying concentrations, and the results demonstrate that the sample with no coating lost a lot of weight owing to the HCL attack. The noticeable difference is that the sample with 10% concentration, Sample B, outperformed the others. One of the most important findings from the tests is that the sample with no coating deteriorates about three times quicker than the sample with coating. This study suggests using a better binder solution, experimenting with different quantities of mango leaves extract and binder solution combinations, and conducting more testing methods for more detailed results.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In PhilSCA-VAB, thesis outputs are produced by graduating students every year. A lot of these are stored in either the school library or an online storage service. While storing them for preservation is normal and expected, it is in their retrieval and access that a problem starts to form: it is difficult to find relevant thesis outputs related to Aircraft Maintenance Technology. Most students would resort to scouring the Internet for thesis outputs that can be used as reference materials, but they are almost always met with difficulties in the form of paywalls, incompleteness and invalidity, and the lack of ease of access. The Thesis Repository System proposed by the researchers is designed to alleviate all those problems and make a step forward in the storage and accessing of AMT thesis outputs. To ascertain the Thesis Repository System’s capabilities in those two areas, a face-to-face structured interview was conducted with a combination of students, AMT research instructors, and an AMT research coordinator as the respondents. Upon using the Thesis Repository System, the respondents were exceedingly satisfied with its capabilities. By drawing results and conclusions from their transcripted and tabulated responses, it was interpreted that the Thesis Repository System is a valid, feasible, and highly effective instrument for accessing and storing relevant thesis outputs related to Aircraft Maintenance Technology. Minor improvements to the system’s design, along with proper funding, are among the recommendations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Local Universities and Colleges (LUCs) being a dynamic organizations need educational leaders who can effectively implement necessary changes for institutional development. Due to demands for reform and accountability, LUCs must meet strict educational standards or face serious consequences. Schools must find leaders that are not just willing, but able to face these challenges by successfully initiating change both for the improvement of the system as well as its ultimate reform. Commission on Higher Education (CHED) promotes Institutional Sustainability Assessment (ISA) because it can serve as a learning process for the HEIs and contribute to its continuing quality cycle for its institutional development. In response to the lack of informed research concerning educational leadership styles correlating to institutional sustainability assessment and outcomes in LUCs, the researcher is motivated to pursue this study and aims to contribute to this pressing issue of LUCs for quality mechanisms, despite of its high political influences and bureaucratic system that affect or hinder the LUCs development. Hence, the purpose of the study is to determine the situational leadership style of the individuals most responsible for changing or maintaining a system and what factors might affect the ability of a person to make meaningful changes in a school setting and the relationship of these leadership styles to ISA Key Results Areas. Descriptive method was used in the study using the Leadership Style Instrument adopted from Hershey and Blanchard and the Self-Evaluation Document of the CHED ISA administered to the LUCs Administrative and Academic Heads, using random sampling technique. The study revealed that coaching, delegating, and directing are the leadership styles exhibited by the school administrators to a moderate extent in a situation. This implies that development level of the subordinates is still in low level. The sampled LUCs “very often practiced” the Institutional sustainability indicators, as a whole. And, it is only the directing leadership style that has a significant positive relationship with governance (r=.224, p<.05); quality of teaching and learning (r=.255, p<.05); and exposure, research and creative work (r=.240, p<.05). This implies that the increase in the use of directing leadership style will also increase the practice of institutional sustainability such as governance; quality of teaching and learning; and exposure, research and creative work.',\n",

This study aimed\\r\\nto analyze the problems of the farmers in cultivating, to help by designing and developing a device that\\r\\ncan determine watermelon’s maturity and sugar level. The device utilizes an AS7263 Near Infrared\\r\\nSpectroscopy sensor (NIRS), BCM2837 (Raspberry Pi 3B), and DHT22 Temperature and Humidity\\r\\nSensor. The device was tested on 20 Sugar Baby Watermelons, and they were categorized under two\\r\\nmaturity categories, ripe and unripe. Consequently, by utilizing the Brix Refractometer the sugar level of\\r\\nwatermelon is categorized into three different levels i.e., low, medium, and high. As a result, the accuracy\\r\\nof the device in determining the maturity of the watermelon is 100%, with an 86.67% accuracy level for\\r\\nthe sugar level determination. This results in an overall 93.33% accuracy level, making it satisfactory in\\r\\nproviding information about the maturity and sugar level of Sugar Baby Watermelons.

The\\r\\nuse of this chamber has the potential to revolutionize the traditional fish drying process, which is\\r\\nfrequently inefficient and inconsistent. The goal of this technology is to ensure that fish is dried evenly\\r\\nand that the required moisture content and salinity levels are met in order to produce high-quality dried\\r\\nfish. A thermostat sensor monitors the chamber's temperature, and a load cell sensor measures the\\r\\nweight of the fish before and after drying. The system can indirectly measure the moisture content of the\\r\\nfish by measuring the weight of the fish before and after drying.\\r\\nA salinometer is also used to regulate the salinity of the fish, ensuring consistent variations in salinity.\\r\\nConsistent salinity levels must be maintained during the drying process to ensure that the fish is evenly\\r\\ndried and retains its quality. The drying process within the chamber is meticulously monitored to ensure\\r\\nthat the fish is evenly dried and that the desired moisture content and salinity levels are met. Fish\\r\\nfarmers and processors can use this technology to produce high-quality, evenly dried fish that meets\\r\\nmarket standards.

       "  'abstract': \"Agriculture that is sustainable is essential if 9.7 billion people are to be fed by the year 2050. It is\\r\\npossible to cultivate plants using hydroponics without using soil,which would save both land and water.\\r\\nUsing the Blynk Internet of Things application, this research will construct an automated rotating\\r\\nhydroponics tower for the production of leafy crops. Crops can be grown vertically in a small space using\\r\\nan automated hydroponic rotating tower system. Plant development is stimulated by rotating the tower\\r\\nstructure so that plants receive even exposure to light. A microcontroller was responsible for all of the\\r\\nsystem's settings. It also helped to reduce the amount of human involvement by maintaining\\r\\ncommunication with the various sensors. An open Internet of Things platform would store and display\\r\\nsystem parameters in addition to providing a graphical user interface for remote access. Plant health can\\r\\nbe maintained with less intervention from the user thanks to the technology. The IoT platform\\r\\nperformed checks on individual system components to ensure proper operation of the entire system.\\r\\nUsers of hydroponic systems are provided with notifications in real time whenever environmental\\r\\nconditions are unfavorable. Therefore, the user is able to remotely adjust the system by monitoring the\\r\\nwater level, temperature, pH, and TDS levels. According to the findings of this study, automated rotating\\r\\ntower hydroponics has the potential to be an environmentally friendly approach to modern agriculture.\\r\\nThe use of automated rotating tower hydroponics might significantly lower the amount of water needed\\r\\nfor crop production while also contributing to the realization of the aims of sustainable agriculture.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"This study addresses the development of a mini fridge powered by a microcontroller that can\\r\\nmonitor the quality and freshness of leafy greens. The system includes a GSM module for remote\\r\\nmonitoring, a sprayer for humidity management, and a Peltier module for cooling. The goal of this\\r\\nproject is to solve the problem of food deterioration brought on by inadequate storage conditions, which\\r\\ncan result in risks to one's health and economic losses.\\r\\nThe project's goals are to develop and put into use a leafy greens storage system that can maintain\\r\\nideal levels of humidity and temperature while also offering real-time monitoring and alert notifications.\\r\\nA Peltier module, a solenoid lock, a sprayer, specifically a water pump, a GSM module, a DHT22, and a\\r\\nmicrocontroller unit that has been set up to sense temperature and humidity sensors are all used in the\\r\\nmethod. For SMS alarm messages and remote monitoring, the GSM module is used. Device is locked\\r\\nwith a solenoid for seven days. Pumping system for water for spraying. The project's findings\\r\\ndemonstrate that the system can maintain the ideal storage conditions for leafy greens, with\\r\\ntemperatures between 17°C and 23°C and humidity levels between 95% and 100%. In the event that\\r\\nleafy greens have already finished 7 days after, the solenoid lock will open and send real-time alerts to\\r\\nthe user's mobile phone. The microcontroller-based mini fridge for leafy greens monitoring system with\\r\\nPeltier and a sprayer with GSM module is an effective and reasonably priced way to maintain ideal\\r\\nstorage conditions. The accuracy test revealed that although the system's cooling system may be\\r\\nenhanced, it is still safe to use with an accuracy of 98.5%. On the other hand, the humidity is really good,\\r\\nand with the aid of the interior sprayer, the humidity is not a major issue. The surveillance system is also\\r\\nprecise. In conclusion, Sharon Farm can use the system.\",\n",

The study found that the sensor and Blynk interface output\\r\\nhad a high accuracy rate of 99.42%. Additionally, the average soil temperature in five trials was 43.42°C,\\r\\nindicating a high temperature classification. The average output of the Soil Moisture Parameter was\\r\\n89.4%, indicating excellent soil moisture.

Urban farming as a potential solution to\\r\\nincrease food security and mitigate the impact of climate change on global supply chains. The declining\\r\\navailability of freshwater resources is a growing threat to humans, and new sustainable technologies\\r\\nsuch as atmospheric water generation techniques may provide a solution to this problem. The WatAir:\\r\\nWater system from air through dehumidification is an automated prototype that features a water\\r\\ngenerator that can produce water from air that may be used to water many types of plants. The system\\r\\nwill draw ambient air in, which will then be dehumidified and turned into water. The sprinkler\\r\\nautomation is handled by the module, which will be configured to water the plants once a day. If the\\r\\nmain tank is recognized to be full, the water level module will act as feedback to cease the generation of\\r\\nwater. The results done on the system demonstrate that the system is effective in terms of collecting\\r\\nwater from the air. The system's overall accuracy rating is 91.68%, indicating a high level of\\r\\ndependability in data collection and operation. The hardware and software used in the creation and\\r\\ntesting of the system are appropriate, workable, and functional.

       "  'abstract': \"In order to live a healthy life, people are paying more attention to the idea of and consumption of\\r\\nfruits and vegetables today. POCAJAM is a vegetable jam made of Potato and Carrots. Potato contains a\\r\\nlot of vitamin C, an antioxidant. Because the vitamin C in potatoes warded against scurvy, they were a\\r\\nlife-saving food supply in earlier times. Potassium, an electrolyte that supports the function of our heart,\\r\\nmuscles, and nervous system, is another important vitamin found in potatoes. While Carrots has Niacin\\r\\nand B6 are two B vitamins that help our bodies utilize food energy, and carrots offer a reasonable supply\\r\\nof these nutrients. B vitamins are essential for healthy skin, hair, nerves, and muscles as well as for\\r\\ngrowth. The vitamin C in carrots helps to maintain the health of our skin, gums, and teeth. It is an ideal\\r\\nvegetable in making a jam because of its high amount of nutrients. One of the most favorite vegetables in\\r\\nthe whole world are potatoes and carrots, that’s why the researchers chose the two vegetables. The aim of\\r\\nthe current study was to develop a jam that is healthy but also delicious for the consumers and in order\\r\\nto assess its sensory, dietary, antioxidant, and storage qualities. The researchers added milk and\\r\\nsweetener to the vegetables for the taste to become better. The study's findings suggest that potato-carrot\\r\\njam has strong sensory qualities and can be used to produce jam and other processed goods to increase\\r\\nthe value of the vegetables\",\n",

One approach\\r\\nto reducing global waste and pollution is the use of recycled materials in everyday products. In the\\r\\nPhilippines, carton boxes are a popular choice for recycled materials.

It is an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic fibers and has\\r\\nbeen gaining popularity in recent years due to its sustainable nature. Banana fiber are easy to acquire\\r\\nspecially in tropical regions where banana trees are common and being cultivated easily.\\r\\nWhile conducting this study we used some methodologies such as a survey questionnaire to be able\\r\\nto answer our questions. Samples are from those who are convenient in the area of Nagkaisang Nayon.\\r\\nIn the other hand we also used the Slovin’s formula to acquire the specific number of respondents of the\\r\\ngiven population.\\r\\nTherefore, we conclude that the usage of banana fiber has several advantages. Banana fibers are a\\r\\nsustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional textile materials, such as cotton or polyester. This\\r\\nis because banana fibers are biodegradable and do not require the use of harmful chemicals during\\r\\nproduction.

       "  'abstract': 'At this point in time, especially now in this technology-driven society and age of advancement, people\\r\\ntend to experiment with new things, and, in our case, we want to introduce a new type of dishwashing\\r\\nliquid. Filipinos are typically known for using dishwashing liquid in their everyday household chores.\\r\\nThe type and brand of dishwashing liquid is the common problem in each household to make dishes as\\r\\nclean as possible. The dishwashing liquid that the researchers made is the cleaning agent that uses\\r\\neggshells as microbeads. The composition of an egg makes it the most versatile ingredient in various\\r\\ncuisines, and commonly, eggshells are the end use of it. And that leads the researchers to determine how\\r\\nto make it useful and proves that eggshells can be reused in many ways that don’t readily come to mind.\\r\\nThe egg shell is abrasive, and by using eggshells as microbeads in our dishwashing liquid, they act like a\\r\\nscrubbing brush to remove debris without using any scrubbing material like steel wool, and they can also\\r\\nunclog drains as they can trap errant solids and clean pipes on their way out. There are two objectives for\\r\\nthis research. First, the product, which is the dishwashing liquid, must be an effective cleaner. Second, it\\r\\nmust be feasible and can generate income. If the researchers find it successful, then this product can be\\r\\nconsidered a good innovation for the dishwashing liquid industry.',\n",

All of these projects wish to resolve the problem on how to replace or mitigate the use of non-\\r\\nrenewable energy sources. One of the recent examples of these projects was called Pavegen tiles. It is a type of Biomechanical energy source that harvests human motion to convert into electricity. These tiles\\r\\nwere installed on the pavements in the UK to collect the Kinetic energy produce while walking and\\r\\ngenerate two to five joules of off-grid energy per step. This idea of generating electricity using\\r\\nbiomechanical movements inspire the design of the proponent’s product called Gener-E-Door.

It is equivalent to two hundred eighty-nine joules assuming that there is no load. The\\r\\nreleased energy will then pass through a buck converter connected to a lithium battery charger with a\\r\\nfive-volt, three amperes input.

These mung bean graham balls will have a variety of coatings, not just\\r\\nfor the design presentation but to attract customers to buy them. The idea is unique as much as the taste\\r\\nof the Graham balls with some additional toppings like chocolate syrup, sprinkles and desiccated\\r\\ncoconut. The reason why this business aims to provide an innovative product that will suit people\\'s tastes\\r\\nand benefit their health.\\r\\nOur product known as “Mung Graham Balls,” is high in nutrients and antioxidants, which may\\r\\nprovide health benefits. In fact, mung beans help and protect us against heat stroke, aid digestive health,\\r\\npromote weight loss and lower “bad” LDL cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar levels. Over and\\r\\nabove the nutritional benefits of graham balls, mung beans are a good combination to make the nutrients\\r\\nbalanced and maintain good health.

The study aims to evaluate the distribution of laptops and pocket Wi-Fi devices as critical components of QCU's strategy to adapt to the new normal in education. Amidst the challenges posed by the pandemic, QCU successfully procured 8,000 laptops and provided monthly internet allowances, demonstrating its commitment to facilitating remote learning. However, the study reveals that the distribution faced obstacles, resulting in 4,358 laptops reaching students by March 2021. Survey data collected from 5,893 QCU students sheds light on the reasons behind the low turnout, with 2,814 students opting not to borrow laptops. Notably, the study identifies various challenges faced by students in the transition to online learning, including unstable internet connections, lack of conducive study environments, and distractions from social media. The findings indicate that while the majority of students benefitted positively from the provided laptops, challenges persist. Respondents expressed a desire to return to face-to-face learning, emphasizing the importance of stable internet connectivity. To address these concerns, the QC Government allocated 5,225 pocket Wi-Fi units to ensure continuous interactions among students and teachers. Recommendations include comprehensive research and planning, a gradual transition to blended learning, additional equipment provisioning, and ongoing orientation and training programs.\\xa0\",\n",

Instant Pancit Canton. Brand activism is a way for companies to express their opinions and values on social, a, or political issues that matter to them and their customers. The gathering of respondents was done in purposive way who were who are from different age groups, socio-economic classes, and regions. The researcher conducted a Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Analysis to measure the statistical association of brand activism on Facebook with various dependent variables. This is a statistical technique that assesses the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. The analysis showed that only brand image and interest level were the independent variables that had a strong positive correlation with the importance of brand activism on Facebook (dependent variable). No significant differences were observed between the responses for C2 Green Tea and Lucky Me! Instant Pancit Canton. This paper advances the general knowledge of brand activism in the Philippine context. It provides practical implications for marketers and advertisers who want to utilize social media platforms to engage with their consumers on relevant social, environmental, or political issues.',\n",

Hence, course selection is one of many important choices that students will make in determining future plans. It becomes one of the biggest dilemma and challenge in any student's life. Hence, the study sought to investigate the course preference among students. The study used quantitative methods of data collection. The quantitative method was done through a survey questionnaire. The respondents are BSED major in English 2B and Science 2 majority are females, their parents' highest educational attainment finished Secondary Graduates have less than P11,690, monthly tuition and consist of 4 to 6 members. Findings revealed that employability, financial status, and availability of job are three of the most considered factors in choosing a college course among BSED English and Science students. It is also concluded that the factors affecting the course preference among students are less extent and that there are no significant differences on the course preference among respondents along all its demographic profile of the students. It is hereby recommended that students must have a clear understanding of what they really wanted in the future before choosing a course in college.\")"
